        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Problem</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">A well-established communication channel with customers is a key requirement to ensure better operations. Setting up seamless operations while maintaining a wide range of customer base without a robust and secure communication channel is a challenge. Thus to convey important information like booking details, offers and updates for building a strong customer relationship, a communication channel targeting wide reach for mass audience (customers) is required.</span>
      </div>

      <div className="container py-5">
        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Solution</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">OxeBox is managing their operations by its app and securing the user accounts efficiently with SMS communications via MSG91 API. With MSG91 APIs and real-time robust system, OTP SMS is delivered to the customers to build communication at different events such as</span>
        <ul>
          <li className="c-fs-3 mt-3">Upon <a href="#"> sign up </a> , the customer receives a <a href="#"> Verification Code SMS </a> to verify the registered mobile number, thereby securing the user account.</li>
        </ul>
        <span className="c-fs-3">This way OxeBox has been able to establish and maintain secure operations with Customers via SMS using MSG91 API.</span>
      </div>

      <div className="container py-5">
        <h1 className="c-fw-b mb-4">Benefit</h1>
        <span className="c-fs-3">As a result, the customer gets verification code for verifying their registered mobile numbers. Thereby protecting the information and bill receipts within their user accounts via a secured channel, making the operations reliable and seamless. This results in a better rapport with the customer and increase in sales.

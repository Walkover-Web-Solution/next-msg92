[MSG91](https://msg91.com/) is proud to be associated with [Twikster](http://twikster.com/index.php?controller=home), an e-commerce enablement platform that lets SMBs get started with their online stores, or as they call it store-y’s. With our SMS API integration, MSG91 is now the official SMS partner for Twikster.


Being far in their reach and easy in their operations, Twikster’s main aim is to create a single-stop destination platform where everything, from setting up the web store to driving traffic to the store is realizable.


Our **SMS API integration** with Twikster provides the following benefits


1. Enables one touch [SMS](https://msg91.com/sms-for-developers)
2. Every client will get [2,000 free transactional SMS](https://msg91.com/transactional-sms)
3. 24×7 priority support


The post here is a step-by-step guide, of how you can integrate our SMS APIs with Twikster.


#### **Figure {1} displays how to integrate MSG91 API in Twikster**

You’ll be asked for an ‘**Auth Key**’ and you can get it on your MSG91 account.

* Enter the ‘**Admin phone**’ number’ [6]
* Save the settings

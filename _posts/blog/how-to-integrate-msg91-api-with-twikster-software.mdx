[MSG91](https://msg91.com/) is proud to be associated with [Twikster](httsp://twikster.com/index.php?controller=home), an e-commerce enablement platform that lets SMBs get started with their online stores, or as they call it store-y’s. With our SMS API integration, MSG91 is now the official SMS partner for Twikster.


Being far in their reach and easy in their operations, Twikster’s main aim is to create a single-stop destination platform where everything, from setting up the web store to driving traffic to the store is realizable.


Our **SMS API integration** with Twikster provides the following benefits


1. Enables one touch [SMS](https://msg91.com/sms-for-developers)
2. Every client will get [2,000 free transactional SMS](https://msg91.com/sms)
3. 24×7 priority support


The post here is a step-by-step guide, of how you can integrate our SMS APIs with Twikster.


#### **Figure {1} displays how to integrate MSG91 API in Twikster**


* [Login](https://twikster.com/index.php?controller=home#) to your Twikster account
* Click on the ‘**Add-Ons**’ option
* Click on the ‘**Notification**’ tab
* To ‘**Enable**’ the settings connect with the Twisker support
* Once it is enabled, click on the ‘**Configure**’ tab
* **Configure**> **Account Settings**> **MSG91 Settings**

You’ll be asked for an ‘**Auth Key**’ and you can get it on your MSG91 account.


#### **Figure {2} displays how to get ‘Authkey’ from MSG91:**


* Create an account with [MSG91](https://msg91.com/signup)
* Login to this account
* Click on ‘**API’**  in the bottom-left corner of the panel and ‘**Generate’** the authkey then copy this authkey

Now getting back to the Twikster page


#### **Figure {3} displays how to get the ‘Authkey’:**


* Paste the copied authkey on ‘**Authkey**’ [2] field (e.g.56555APUaRa5a4eada)
* For transactional SMS the ‘**Route**’ [3] should be set as **4**
* Add the desired sender ID in ‘**Sender**’ [4] field ([Sender ID](https://msg91.com/help/what-is-a-sender-id) defines the sender (your identity) and the intent (purpose) of the message. It serves like the subject line of an e-mail
* For ‘**HTTP API**’ [5] use> **control.msg91.com/api/sendhttp.php**
* Enter the ‘**Admin phone**’ number’ [6]
* Save the settings

And so the message industry has a lot to offer to the users, including a variety of messages like **Bulk SMS, transactional SMS, Long code and short code SMS, and Voice SMS.** When so many options are available, why not choose Voice SMS which has *individuality* attached to it.

1. No Need to Type Messages Multiple Times
One of the major drawbacks of text message is that one needs to type the message multiple times before hitting the send option. And the best feature of voice messages is that you do not need to type messages multiple times like you need to do with text messages.


2. A Much Better Way of Advertising
Messaging is any day a much better way of advertising as compared to the other modes of promoting a product. One can easily opt for voice messages for that matter. This is solely because customers need a brand they can rely upon, something good enough to trust. Voice SMS facilitates this option and by adding a certain feel to the message, customers can easily establish trust in the product.


3. Creating a Larger Impact on The End Users
Statistics show that people generally retain those messages easily and for a longer duration which carry a personal touch. And what could be better than voice messages, which can be sent in the voice of the marketer, which *creates a much larger impact on the end users* as compared to other ways of marketing.


4. Customers Can Be Easily Drawn Towards The Product
Since voice SMS give a personal feel to the messages, customers can be easily drawn towards the product. *The retention power of voice SMS is therefore much greater than other types of promotional methods.*



> Market your products at ease, but with a personal touch by making use of voice SMS as a feelings-equipped option.

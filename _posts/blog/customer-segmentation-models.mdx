## **What Are Customer Segmentation Models?**

To segment is to see—to recognize that a million customers hold a million reasons in their hearts. **Customer segmentation models** are structured blueprints, designed not only to sort but to reveal. They go beyond simple grouping, using layered data—demographics, behaviors, psychographics—to create living, breathing profiles. Basic segmentation is a sketch; these models are a painting.

With predictive analytics and AI-driven insight, Segmento at [msg91.com/segmento](https://msg91.com/segmento) brings these models to life, enabling you to personalize every touchpoint, anticipate desire, and move with your customer through every stage of their journey.

## **8 Common Types of Customer Segmentation Models**

### **Demographic Segmentation**

Like a census-taker with a poet’s gaze—dividing by age, gender, income, education.  
 _Example:_ A clothing retailer, eyes open for students, offers special discounts to those under 24\.

### **Geographic Segmentation**

Where you are is who you are, sometimes. Country, city, even climate—each shaping desire.  
 _Example:_ In a city where the monsoon pounds, Segmento triggers a raincoat campaign at just the right moment.

#### **Behavioral Segmentation**

We are what we do. Buying, browsing, abandoning carts—each gesture tells a tale.  
 _Example:_ An eCommerce brand, using [Segmento](https://msg91.com/segmento), sends a gentle nudge to those who wandered but did not buy.

### **Psychographic Segmentation**

Beneath behavior, belief. Lifestyle, values, dreams.  
 _Example:_ A luxury travel brand tailors its offers for thrill-seekers and quiet romantics alike.

### **Technographic Segmentation**

What is in your pocket, what’s on your desk—these reveal your habits.  
 _Example:_ [MSG91.com](https://msg91.com) clients launch campaigns only for Android power users, skipping the iOS crowd.

### **Needs-Based Segmentation**

The pain behind the purchase. What are they seeking?

_Example:_ A SaaS company, finding clients searching for deep analytics, targets them with the promise of clarity.

### **Value-Based Segmentation**

Some customers are golden—spending more, staying longer.  
 _Example:_ An airline uses [Segmento](https://msg91.com/segmento) to single out its most loyal flyers, offering upgrades and secret perks.

#### **Firmographic Segmentation (for B2B)**

Companies, too, have biographies—industry, size, ambition.  
 _Example:_ An IT firm at [MSG91](https://msg91.com) finds the giants among its leads and writes them a different pitch.

With Segmento, every model is a click away—a dashboard not of data, but of destinies.

**What is Meant by OTP?** 

OTP or one-time password refers to the random and uniquely generated code or **OTP verification number** which is generated while performing a confidential transaction and sent to the mobile phone as SMS or email address of that person for [**OTP verification**](https://msg91.com/send-otp/) and authentication.

**What Does SendOTP Mean**?   
SendOTP is a MSG91 flagship product that is revolutionizing the way two-factor authentication services operate. SendOTP facilitates the generation, delivery, and verification of OTP code with fail-proof solutions in place. To understand [SendOTP](https://msg91.com/send-otp/) more easily, we need to address this question: what is 2 FA?

**What Is 2-Factor Authentication?**

When an online security incident occurs, there is a huge chance that it will adversely affect us, our business, and those around us. For example, someone unauthorized might gain access to your social media accounts. At worst, it might mean fraudsters gaining access to your online bank account and walking away with your savings; or someone hacking into your smart home monitoring system to survey your movements.

The regular login process, where you just input your password and gain access to your online account or system is referred to as one-factor authentication. This mechanism is prone to unauthorized access activities. For instance, imagine having your password falling into the wrong hands; the one in possession of your password will just have to pull up your account, input your password, and gain access.

With two-factor authentication, the second layer of authentication is added to your regular way of logging in with your password. This second layer of authentication comes in form of a One Time Password (OTP).

Now let us discuss in-depth about our dedicated platform SendOTP.

**How Does SendOTP Work?**

SendOTP facilitates 2-FA authentication by generating an OTP code, delivering it to a user, and verifying the code. The system works in three steps: Generation, Delivery, and Verification.

1. Generation – This involves the generation of a random **OTP verification number**.
2. Delivery – After generation, the code is sent to the user via SMS or voice. SMS is our primary form of delivery. If SMS OTP fails – which is very rare, Voice OTP is used as an alternative.
3. Verification – After the user inputs the OTP code, our SendOTP system verifies it using the code it generated prior.

With SendOTP all a user needs to do is:

1. Verify the phone number.

2. Enter the verification code.

The user is verified in just two steps and all it takes is 120 seconds.

[SendOTP](https://msg91.com/send-otp/) maintains a database for the sent OTPs and they can be easily filtered. It reduces a significant amount of coding on the application part making it lighter.

*P.S. SendOTP uses the integrated services of MSG91*  


**Benefits of using SendOTP**

Using MSG91 SendOTP as 2FA reduces the dependency on passwords decreasing vulnerability and the chance of an adverse cyber attack. The OTP that is produced and sent over SMS to input along with the password is for one-time use only and changes with every login making it dynamic.

The algorithm attached to SendOTP makes it unique as it does not, in any case, let the OTP fail. If undelivered by SMS, the OTP is sent over a voice call ensuring your OTP is delivered; come what may.

**How Does An OTP Service Work?**

OTP is one of the components used in two-factor authentication. An **OTP verification number** is a random code sent to a user trying to log into a system that implements a 2-FA. The code is meant to confirm the identity of whoever is trying to login. A website that implements 2-FA has an OTP generating program referred to as an OTP token. The token is also responsible for sending and verification of OTP.

One Time Password, as the name suggests, can only be used once and never to be reused again. The **OTP numbers** or code are valid for a very short period, usually up to 5 mins. This short validity period is what makes OTP very secure and dynamic in relation to the regular static passwords.

An OTP process is triggered when a user enters their login details (username and password) in a system that implements a 2-FA system; after entry and clicking the login button, a prompt requirement for an OTP pops up. The OTP process is affected by three steps: generation, delivery, and verification.

The first step in an OTP process is the generation of the OTP code.

****How Is OTP Generated?****

The OTP token uses pseudorandomness or randomness to generate a short and random code. The code is then delivered to the user through their registered mobile number, either by SMS or voice. After delivery, the user has a one-time chance to use the code. The user enters this **OTP verification** code on the prompt, the verification process is initiated.  


**What Is OTP Verification?**

[**OTP verification**](https://msg91.com/send-otp/) refers to the process where the OTP token verifies the code entered with the one it generated. The login process is achieved if the tokens match.

**Understanding The Two Types Of OTP Services**

There are two types of OTP services, based on how OTP is delivered to the user: SMS OTP and Voice OTP services.

**What is SMS OTP**:   
With an approximately 97% open rate within the first 30 seconds, SMS is known for its high reliability. It is the primary form of delivering OTPs and for SMS OTP verification. Through this form, you are assured to reach virtually all of your customers. Even without the internet, users can still receive SMS.

**What is Voice OTP service**:   
An alternative or backup to SMS OTP is Voice OTP. With this form, the OTP is received as a phone call on the user’s mobile phone. Voice OTP service allows you to reach those customers with limited sight. Voice OTP is commonly used as a backup to SMS OTP, but they can be both interoperated.

**Choosing The Right OTP Service Provider**

As a business owner, you can choose your preferred OTP-based two-factor authentication from a variety of OTP providers, such as MSG91. These providers offer OTP as a service that can be incorporated into your computer systems. There are multiple OTP service providers out there, all it takes is to compare their services and choose one that suits your needs. With OTP service provision, you need to make sure that the company you are relying on is experienced enough to provide seamless services.

Make a list of OTP providers and compare their rates and their way of business. The provider should be proactive enough in sending SMS to your customers. In case of a technical glitch or delay, your service provider should have technical support on standby to fix the issue. In making a decision on choosing your provider, make inquiries about their experience, credentials and licenses.

Operational efficiency is what determines a reliable service provider from the others; and if you are failing to come across a dependable one, conduct more thorough research. 

In addition, different service providers have different OTP service plans with different prices; for instance, some only provide SMS OTP, some Voice OTP, and others provide both. It is upon you to find a service provider with a package that is affordable to you. However, you should not trade affordability with efficiency, because what is the point of having a cheap service that does not satisfy your needs.

Also, check out businesses and brands that have previously done business or collaborated with your shortlisted providers, or are currently doing business with them. An OTP with prominent business partners is an assurance of how well they conduct their business.

You should also request delivery reports from your shortlisted providers; delivery reports act as their credentials, and they should be happy to provide them. OTP plays a primarily crucial role in online transactions, and it all depends on the service provider. 

Therefore, if you have a business that does a lot of transactions, your OTP provider will be playing a central role in your business productivity. Also, check our other services your shortlisted providers provide and see if any interests you; chances are the provider will be able to give you a discount if you subscribe to more than one service.

Social media presence and word of mouth are also some primary ways of looking for an OTP provider. After successfully getting a provider of your choice, it’s advisable to stick with it as you build mutual trust, mutual trust goes a long way in building supportive business partners.

To recap, the following are factors to consider in looking for an OTP service provider that might be good for your business:

1. **Delivery rates**: SMS might be the most stable form of delivering OTP, but if your provider’s OTP infrastructure is not efficient, you are in for slow and unreliable delivery of OTPs to your customers. Therefore, it is highly advisable to choose an OTP provider that can assure you of reliable delivery and virtually zero latencies.
2. **Flexible APIs:** If you are implementing an OTP service that leverages an API, make sure you choose an API provider with flexible APIs that can seamlessly be incorporated into your system.
3. **Data Security:** The security of your customers’ data is paramount, and your business depends on it. Therefore, ensure that you choose an ISO certified OTP provider that exercises very top security practices.
4. **Scalability**: Business needs changes over time. At one point you are making the most of your few customers, next you are dealing with a huge customer base. Your OTP provider should have services scalable enough to adapt to this kind of changing business needs.
5. **Customer service**: Just as you depend on your customer service to keep your customer happy and satisfied, your OTP service provider should also be caring enough to have functional customer service.

**Conclusion**

Technological advances have presented an opportunity for businesses to expand their coverage, and to reach every potential customer wherever they are. However, with increased opportunity comes increased responsibility, along with heightened vulnerability. Most businesses operate e-commerce platforms, which require customers to operate an account; an account that requires login details. 

Users are naturally inclined to use short and simple login credentials that are memorable to them. To hackers, this presents a good opportunity for their endeavours. Faced with this fact, businesses are and should be deploying OTP-based two-factor authentication systems and **OTP verification** to provide a second layer of protection.

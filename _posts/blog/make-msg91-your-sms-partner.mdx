Do you know the first thing 80% of millennials do right after they wake up is to check their mobile phones? On average, we check our phones [85 times](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3294994/How-check-phone-Average-user-picks-device-85-times-DAY-twice-realise.html) a day.


Almost everyone these days is arrested in their mobile phones either to stay connected with social media or to find information. We’ve all become highly dependent on our phones. But in a way, this dependency has also opened up opportunities for businesses to reach their customers through a medium where they are always available.


Businesses are swiftly shifting towards the mobile advertising trend (which no doubt is the most predominant way to reach an audience today). But it only works if the message reaches directly to the consumer – in their mobile inbox.


The medium is the message
=========================


MSG91 – SMS Communication At Its Best!
======================================


**So what does MSG91 do and how does it help with your business communication?**


For starters, MSG91 is a cloud communication platform that helps businesses communicate with their customers through SMS (prominently) and other communication APIs.


It’s trusted by 10,000+ businesses (SMEs and Enterprises) all over the world for their SMS communication by companies like ICICI Prudential, MakeMyTrip, Ixigo, Mahindra, RazorPay, Godrej, Policy Bazaar, Xiaomi and more.


Before I tell you more about how MSG91 can enhance your business communication via SMS, let us talk about SMS marketing and why it is important.


Why Is SMS Marketing Important?
-------------------------------


Phone calls can go unanswered, emails can sit unread for days, but text messages are open and read almost immediately when received.


SMS marketing not only allows businesses to reach directly to their customers but is also a powerful medium for sending important updates on time with higher security and utmost efficiency. 


Still underrated, SMS marketing allows you to:


* Personalize your brand communication
* Send instant updates
* Automate communication
* Track & optimize
* Get best engagement rates
* Enable two-way communication


Why SMS Marketing Should Be An Integral Part Of Your Communication Strategy?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Customers want to be communicated in a way that’s handy, a way that is non-disruptive yet easily accessible. And, SMS marketing fits the bill.


Quick and convenient for businesses, they can send out SMS in bulk all at once at the click of a button. Also, they can then track who opened their messages, clicked their links, acted on the messages and even see who has unsubscribed from their messages.


Today’s time is all about staying connected with the audience and no business can survive without effective communication. SMS marketing is one of the easiest and quickest ways to communicate and connect that’s prevalent across all industries.

RCS (Rich Communication Services) is the future of messaging — interactive, rich, and engaging. But every brand faces the same problem: sometimes RCS messages don’t deliver.

When your messages fail, it’s more than a technical issue — it’s a missed opportunity to connect with customers, complete orders, or build trust.

If you’ve ever searched:

* “What to do for RCS failure?”

* “RCS messages are not delivering”

* “How to increase RCS delivery rate”

* “My RCS messages are not being delivered, what to do?”

— you’re not alone. MSG91’s Campaign Tool is designed to answer all these questions.

## Why RCS Messages Fail

Even the best campaigns can face challenges:

* Customer devices or messaging apps that do not support RCS

* Carrier restrictions or temporary network issues

* Expired business verification or inactive agents

These are common, real-world issues. And while RCS can fail, your customer communication doesn’t have to.

## MSG91 [Campaign](https://msg91.com/in/campaign) Tool: The Solution for Every RCS Challenge

The Campaign Tool ensures that every RCS message reaches its customer, even when the primary channel fails. It’s currently free, and you can create unlimited personalised customer journeys to match any use case.

### \~Intelligent Fallbacks

Define your fallback channels to ensure message continuity:

Primary: RCS → Fallback: WhatsApp → SMS → Email

Each fallback message can be personalised and actionable, making sure your communication feels human, natural, and consistent.

### \~Smart Delays and Message Limits

Set custom delays and limits so your outreach is timely, thoughtful, and never intrusive. This ensures your messages feel personal, not automated.

### \~Personalised Customer Journeys

Transform campaigns into meaningful conversations. Create automated, cross-channel journeys that adapt based on user behaviour — every customer receives the right message at the right time, on the right platform.

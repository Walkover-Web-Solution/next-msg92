For businesses using WhatsApp as a core communication tool, reaching and engaging customers at scale is essential. However, WhatsApp imposes messaging tier limits, which determine how many business-initiated messages you can send in a 24-hour period. These limits start at 250 messages per day and can be increased to 10,000, 100,000, or even unlimited, depending on how well you meet specific criteria.

To ensure your messaging limits grow as your business expands, here are the best practices you should follow:

 **1\. Get Your Business Verified**

Business verification is the first step to increasing your messaging tier. Meta (WhatsApp’s parent company) prefers verified businesses for tier upgrades, as it demonstrates legitimacy and trustworthiness. Once verified, Meta will analyze your message quality and other factors to determine if you're eligible for a limit increase.

**How to Verify Your Business:**  
\- Make sure your business details are complete and accurate.  
\- Submit the required documents through WhatsApp Manager’s “Overview” section.  
\- Verification also helps enhance the visibility of your brand on WhatsApp, as verified businesses show a green checkmark next to their profile.

Verification doesn’t automatically increase your messaging limit, but it is a critical prerequisite to unlock higher tiers quickly.

 **2\. Send Messages Close to Your Current Limit**

If your current limit is 1,000 messages per 24 hours, aim to send as close to that number as possible. Sending a high volume of messages consistently signals to Meta that your business needs a higher limit. This also shows that you’re actively engaging with your customers without exceeding the limit.

For example, if your limit is 1,000 messages, try to send 990+ messages every day. To make this easier, MSG91 offers a campaign feature where you can set the maximum number of messages to send per day. This automated system allows you to stay within your limit while pushing toward a tier increase.

 **3\. Open 1,000+ Conversations in 30 Days**

Meta requires businesses to open at least 1,000 business-initiated conversations within a rolling 30-day period to consider them for a tier upgrade. These conversations should be initiated with unique customers using WhatsApp message templates, and the messages need to be of high quality.

**Here’s what you need to do:**  
\- Use WhatsApp-approved message templates to initiate conversations.  
\- Ensure that these messages comply with WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy.  
\- Avoid spamming, and only message users who have opted in to receive communication.

Meta analyzes these conversations for quality and customer response. The better your engagement and the fewer complaints or message blocks, the higher your chances of a tier increase.

 **4\. Maintain a High-Quality Messaging Rating**

Meta evaluates the quality of your messages through a WhatsApp Quality Rating system. This system classifies your messaging into three categories:  
\- Green: High quality  
\- Yellow: Medium quality  
\- Red: Low quality

A high-quality rating (green) increases your chances of getting a messaging limit upgrade. A low-quality rating (red) can result in your account being flagged or restricted. If your rating drops to low, Meta will warn you via WhatsApp Business Manager and email. If it remains low for over seven consecutive days, your messaging limit might be downgraded.

**To maintain a high-quality rating:**  
\- Send personalized, relevant messages that add value to your customers.  
\- Avoid generic or promotional messages that can lead to blocks or complaints.  
\- Always follow WhatsApp’s opt-in rules and ensure your customers have agreed to receive messages from you.

 **5\. Use MSG91’s Campaign Feature to Manage Messaging**

Managing your message volume is crucial for increasing your messaging limit. With MSG91’s campaign feature, you can control the number of messages sent each day, ensuring you stay within your limit while pushing towards a higher tier. This feature allows businesses to:  
\- Set daily message limits based on current tiers.  
\- Track message performance and engagement.  
\- Optimize messaging strategies by sending the right amount of messages at the right time.

This automation helps you reach your audience efficiently while demonstrating to Meta that your business needs a higher messaging limit. Learn more and set up a campaign here: [Create a campaign with MSG91](http://m.9m.io/jfqk9xf).

 **6\. Request a Messaging Tier Upgrade**

If you’ve completed business verification, maintained a high-quality rating, and met the required number of conversations, but your messaging limit hasn’t increased, you can directly request an upgrade. Here’s how:  
\- Go to Ask a Question in WhatsApp Manager.  
\- Select WABiz: Phone Number & Registration.  
\- Choose Request a Messaging Tier Upgrade.  
Meta will review your request and decide based on your business’s performance and message quality.

 **7\. Understand WhatsApp’s Criteria for Messaging Limits**

WhatsApp’s criteria for increasing messaging limits are based on the number of unique conversations initiated and the quality of your interactions. To get from 1,000 to 10,000 or higher:  
\- Your quality rating must be “Medium” or “High”.  
\- You should initiate conversations with more than half of your current message limit within a seven-day period.  
\- The phone number must be "Connected", and the business must comply with all WhatsApp policies.

 **Conclusion**

Increasing your WhatsApp messaging limit is key to scaling your communication efforts. By following best practices such as business verification, maintaining a high-quality rating, sending messages close to your limit, and using tools like MSG91’s campaign feature, you can significantly improve your chances of moving to the next messaging tier.

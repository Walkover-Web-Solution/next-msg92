Thinking about building a plugin or writing code to integrate any third-party application?


Third-party integration is now a two-minute job that does not require your precious developer time as we’ve written all the codes for it. All you need to do is copy and paste them. 

Sounds simple?


It is and that too without any charge!


We at MSG91 have taken an innovative initiation that will assist you in integrating your application with other third-party applications such as Trello, Slack, WooCommerce, OpenCart, Magento, Shopify, Twitter, Capsule CRM, MailChimp, MailClark, Evernote, Typeform, Asana, Dropbox, Salesforce, Pipedrive, WordPress, Zendesk, Jira, Twilio, Linkedin, Wunderlist, Stripe, PayPal, Toggl, Freshbooks, OneNote, Desk, Zoho, WHMCS, Vtiger, LiveChat, Sidekick, Joomla and other **1000+ applications and tools.**


Want to know what to do? Take a cue from the few examples shared below,


Trigger—> Action+Action+… :


* When I get a new **email**—> Parse that mail into **Slack**
* If someone ordered a product from my **WooCommerce** store —> Send an **email/SMS** or create an entry in **Google Spreadsheet**
* When new user **signup** on website —> Send data on **Hubspot**
* **WordPress**—> Slack/Trello/Capsule CRM or **any other third-party tool**
* Any **Webhook**—> Any **third party tool**(s)


Our team will gladly assist you with your first integration and the next time you wish to integrate another app, you’d be able to do it all by yourself. 


One of the best aspects of MSG91s company culture is that the entire team is up for customer support. Together, these practices give each teammate a stake in our customers’ concerns, and they often expose us to new and valuable ways to use  [MSG91 for business](https://msg91.com "SMS for business").


One last thing, if by mistake you didn’t purchase SMS from MSG91 and would like to integrate other third-party application, no worries, we are game for it.


We’re very much interested to know what initiation are you taking up?

**Defining Chatbots and Conversational AI**

A **chatbot** in MSG91 Hello is your rules-based assistant. It’s quick to build and runs on your terms—answering FAQs, booking appointments, and more, using logic you set up with clicks, not code.

**Conversational AI** in MSG91 Hello goes a step further: it understands customer intent, supports multiple languages, and handles complex, natural conversations—across WhatsApp, voice, SMS, email, and more.  
 Unlike other platforms, both are part of the Hello plan. There’s no need for a separate contract, extra training, or a big investment.

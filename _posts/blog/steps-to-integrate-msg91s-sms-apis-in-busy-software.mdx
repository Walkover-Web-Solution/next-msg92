We understand that it must be a tedious task when you have to integrate SMS APIs all by yourself. We don’t want you to be worried about integrating APIs anymore. This post here is the step-by-step guide of how you can integrate our SMS APIs with ‘Busy’ software. All you have to do is follow these steps:


 


* Create an account with [MSG91](https://msg91.com/signup) and login
* Click on ‘**API’**  in the bottom-left corner of the panel and ‘**Generate’** the authkey then copy this authkey

* Now paste the sample API that you have copied from msg91.com


Example: https://www.control.msg91.com/api/sendhttp.php?


authkey=YourAuthKey&mobiles=Mobile&message=messages&sender=senderid&route=4


 


* Set the parameters – [SenderID](https://msg91.com/help/what-is-a-sender-id), Mobile number, Message, Authkey and [Route](https://msg91.com/help/MSG91/what-is-the-difference-between-transactional-promotional-and-sendotp-route)


 


 


[![Api Config](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/content/images/wordpress/2016/06/Api-Config.png)](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/content/images/wordpress/Api-Config.png)

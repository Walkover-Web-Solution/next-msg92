We understand that it must be a tedious task when you have to integrate SMS APIs all by yourself. We don’t want you to be worried about integrating APIs anymore. This post here is the step-by-step guide of how you can integrate our SMS APIs with ‘Busy’ software. All you have to do is follow these steps:


 


* Create an account with [MSG91](https://msg91.com/signup) and login
* Click on ‘**API’**  in the bottom-left corner of the panel and ‘**Generate’** the authkey then copy this authkey


 


![api-key-14-40-31](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/content/images/wordpress/2016/08/api-key-14-40-31-1.png)


 


* Open ‘Busy’
* Now, click on configure or press ‘**F**’

* Now paste the sample API that you have copied from msg91.com


Example: http://www.control.msg91.com/api/sendhttp.php?


authkey=YourAuthKey&mobiles=Mobile&message=messages&sender=senderid&route=4


 


* Set the parameters – [SenderID](http://help.msg91.com/article/40-what-is-a-sender-id-how-to-select-a-sender-id), Mobile number, Message, Authkey and [Route](http://help.msg91.com/article/64-what-is-the-difference-between-transactional-and-promotional-smsroute)


 


 


[![Api Config](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/content/images/wordpress/2016/06/Api-Config.png)](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/content/images/wordpress/Api-Config.png)


 


 


* Now click on ‘**Save**‘ and our API is integrated with this software. You are now all set to send SMS through our platform.

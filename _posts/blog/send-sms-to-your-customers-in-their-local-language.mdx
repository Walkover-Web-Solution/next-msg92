When it comes to customer communication, it goes without saying that you must engage your consumers in their regional language; for instance, Chinese is spoken in China, English is primarily spoken by British and Americans, Spanish is spoken in Spain and South America, French is spoken in France and West Africa.

In India, while English and Hindi are the official languages, there are hundreds of other indigenous languages spoken in the South Asian country. And even within those indigenous languages, there are different dialects spoken by different quarters. According to statistics, 41% of Indians speak in English as their first language, while the remaining 59% speak in their indigenous languages.

Conversing with clients in their native language is not a novel concept. Businesses and service platforms all around the world have been doing it for ages. For instance, the Q&A platform Quora launched in Hindi and has plans to introduce the platform in other regional languages. Wikipedia itself is available in 22 Indian languages. Facebook too is available in several local languages. According to a study by Google and KPMG, local language consumption is four times that of the English language. It’s just that when it comes to mobile marketing this medium has been overlooked until recently.

With the Unicode English SMS language, you can send SMS in 18 regional languages including Hindi. This feature allows you to reach directly to your targeted audience, increasing your chances of conversion as communicating with any person in their native language is more effective.

Apart from [SMS in English](https://msg91.com/regional-sms/), communicating with your customers in their local language increases the chances of conversions, especially in India as it is a country of diverse languages.

If for example, you are marketing in the Maharashtra region of India, you should engage them in their local language – Marathi. And if you want to create a more personal touch with your audience within Marathi speaking people, you should structure your [Marathi text msg](https://msg91.com/regional-sms/) to include their dialects – for example, Zadiboli, Varhadi, Ahirani, and Konkani. The same goes for Tamil msg and Telugu text messages - SMS in Tamil language and SMS in Telugu should have their respective dialects. If you are attaching your customers’ names in your SMS, consider their proper spellings, because even a name in regional languages may be spelled differently.

**Why Local Language Marketing Is Important**

1. **High consumption of Indian language on the Internet** – Rapid internet penetration, affordable mobile data connections, and improving digital literacy are factors that have contributed to the high consumption of Indian languages on the Internet. This trend has led to aspects such as chat applications, online government services, and ad platforms growing in the Indian language user base. To highlight how important local language is to your marketing, 60% of Indian internet users opine that limited Indian content is the major limiting factor.
2. **The future of Indian language on the internet** – It is projected that 90% of new internet users in India are expected to be Indian speaking people. Also, the Indian government is intensifying digital literacy among those in rural areas. This rapid shift highlights the importance for businesses to adopt native Indian languages in their marketing.

**The Relevance Of Local Languages In Marketing**

In most regions, there is a disproportion between the quantity of digital content in the local language and the size of the audience. Most marketing campaigns stick to the official languages of its audience and not its native languages. This creates an opportunity for those businesses looking for an edge over their competitors. The following are the reasons why local languages are relevant for marketing:

1. **Huge target audience** – In marketing, the size of your audience might just be the difference between a successful and unsuccessful campaign. If you are targeting India, you cannot neglect more than 500 million native speaking people – languages such as Bengali and Tamil also have a significant user base.
2. **Improved engagement** – Nothing intensifies business-consumer engagement more than a conversation with a personal touch in it. And nothing sparks a personal touch more than conversing in the native language. Engaging consumers in their native language is a recipe for positive responses and productive engagement.
3. **Marketing advantage** – Language is more of a culture, and people are emotionally attached to their culture. Therefore, connecting with them in a native language is helpful. Even if your audience perfectly understands English, engaging them in their local language is more impactful.
4. **New Internet users** – With the government's intensified effort to educate its rural population on digital content, businesses have an opportunity to tap into this new user base. And since rural populations primarily speak in their native languages, any productive engagement requires the business to adopt these languages in their marketing strategies.

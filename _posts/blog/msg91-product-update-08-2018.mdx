* **Improved User Interface: Our new Use Interface will make it more easy to use and hassle-free. We have merged Custom SMS within Send SMS. When you try to add numbers in Send SMS, you will receive the option to upload a file, or use existing groups and personalize the message using custom values, as before.** **![](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-28-at-5.47.48-PM-1024x567.png)****![](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/content/images/wordpress/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-28-at-5.48.34-PM-1024x484.png)**


 


 


 


* **Login via Email and Magic Link: To provide you with better security, we are doing away with passwords. Now you can login directly via email address or a magic link that will be sent to your registered email address. Your Email ID *(their email ID)* alone will be used to login to your MSG91 account. [Login Now!](https://control.msg91.com/signin/)**


 


 


**Note:**


* Your current username and password will be used only to login to addons like Spreadsheets, [Excel plugin](https://msg91.com/sms-for-spreadsheets/), etc.
* All your Authentication Keys (Auth Key) will remain valid and work the same way.

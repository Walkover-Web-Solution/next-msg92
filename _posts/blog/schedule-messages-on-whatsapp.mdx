## **Why Schedule Messages on WhatsApp?**

I used to rely on sticky notes and alarms to remind myself to send important messages. Now, it’s hands-off. Scheduling WhatsApp messages helps me:

-   Send birthday or festival wishes right on time

-   Avoid missing follow-ups or payment nudges

-   Stay consistent in campaigns

For businesses, the benefits go even deeper:

-   **Lead nurturing**: Schedule post-signup messages or demo follow-ups.

-   **Customer support**: Auto-respond after working hours.

-   **Promotions**: Pre-plan festival campaigns or daily offers.

The demand for **automated communication** is rising, and scheduling messages is at the center of it.

## **Native Capabilities and WhatsApp’s Limitations**

Let’s be clear — **WhatsApp itself doesn’t support scheduled messages natively**. There's no “send later” button.

That’s why smart automation tools like MSG91’s campaign scheduler (powered by WhatsApp Business API) are essential. These tools handle the timing and delivery, so you don’t have to set reminders or stay online.

### **MSG91 Campaign Scheduler**

And then there’s what I use now: [MSG91 Campaigns](https://msg91.com/campaign).

With MSG91, you can:

-   **Upload a CSV** with numbers and custom fields

-   **Paste mobile numbers** manually

-   **Choose pre-saved segments** from your contacts

_“I often just copy numbers from my sheet or pick the pre-tagged group I created earlier — no repeated effort.”_

Once your content and segment are ready, just pick the date and time. MSG91 takes care of the rest.

These tools allow you to schedule messages on WhatsApp **without needing constant manual effort.**

## **How to Schedule WhatsApp Messages with MSG91 (Step-by-Step)**

Whether you’re new or already using MSG91, scheduling is straightforward. Here’s how I do it:

### **Step 1: Login & Select ‘Campaigns’**

Go to your MSG91 dashboard → click on “Campaigns” → choose “WhatsApp”.

### **Step 2: Choose the Audience**

You have three options:

-   Upload a CSV (ideal if you have customer name, location, or custom data)

-   Paste mobile numbers (handy for quick sends)

-   Select a saved segment (great for recurring campaigns — and if you’re new to segments, [learn how Segmento works here](https://msg91.com/segmento)).

### **Step 3: Draft the Message**

You can choose from your approved templates (required by WhatsApp). Personalization tokens like _`{{name}}`_ or _`{{order\_id}}`_ make it feel more human.

### **Step 4: Schedule the Time**

Pick the exact **date and time**. MSG91 aligns this with WhatsApp’s policies and ensures timely delivery.

_“I once scheduled a Diwali message a week in advance. It went to 8,000+ customers on the dot — while I was enjoying sweets with my family.”_

### **Step 5: Launch & Relax**

Once scheduled, you can track delivery, engagement, and get campaign insights in real-time.

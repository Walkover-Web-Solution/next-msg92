We’re thrilled to announce that MSG91 has acquired [ToSMS](http://tosms.in/), a mobile messaging company based in Kolkata, West Bengal. 


ToSMS provides consumers with community and personalized services that include SMS and Voice. This acquisition accelerates our vision and strategy for meeting the demands of the marketplace delivering relevant messaging services to consumers as well as offering new tools and programs. 


The acquisition is a part of our strategy of acquiring companies that have technologies we can build as part of the fabric of MSG91. We believe our customers need applications built on one technology foundation, resulting in just a single version of MSG91.


ToSMS’s technology and talent will strengthen our position in the emerging era of enterprise messaging, where we bring together the power of communication— connecting people to knowledge, information, services and other people in more relevant and simple ways. 


The ToSMS team’s expertise around mobile messaging, HLR Lookup, Voice SMS make them a great fit to join the MSG91 team, especially with the work we’re doing in the area of communication. 


Founded in 2013 by Manas Chowdhury, an experienced leader, and entrepreneur in the field of SMS communication, ToSMS has already been gaining industry expertise in this field. Manas is a unique talent and a well-respected thought leader in this area. We are confident that he will make significant contributions to our ever-evolving platform.


ToSMS is now integrated with MSG91. Its existing customers are welcomed to MSG91-level support and continued improvements to the service. Besides customers, we heartily welcome ToSMS partners also to the MSG91 family. We are confident the ToSMS acquisition will help us further our ambition.

What if **one email** could speak in **a thousand different ways**—based on who’s reading it?

With **Handlebars in MSG91**, that’s exactly what you get: the power to send **personalized, data-driven emails at scale** without creating separate templates for every use case.

No copy-pasting. No complexity. Just one smart template that adapts automatically to each user.

It’s not just a tool—it’s your **personalization engine**, built right into every send.

## **What is Handlebars and Why It Matters?**

**Handlebars** is a dynamic templating language in MSG91 that lets you insert real-time data and logic into your email templates.

Beyond just using `{{name}}`, you can:

-   Display personalized product recommendations

-   Adjust messages based on location, user status, or cart activity

-   Serve multiple segments with a single smart template

You build one email. Handlebars make it feel personal for each recipient.

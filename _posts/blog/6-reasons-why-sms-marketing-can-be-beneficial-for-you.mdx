**1.** **Broadening your reach** 


On one hand where Email marketing campaigns are able to reach only 10% customers out there, SMS marketing helps to reach at least 90% public, out of which maximum people show interest in the product. Your reach is therefore broadened since a variety of interested people can be reached with SMS marketing.


**2.** **EVERYONE has got a cell phone**


Isn’t this reason sufficient enough to let you guess what SMS marketing can do for you? Well, in today’s time, everyone has got a cell phone, and everyone uses messaging as an option to communicate their near ones. So why not use SMS as a mode to get in touch with your customers too?


**3.** **User response just got a wee bit quicker**


The sheer fact that text messaging facilitates two-way communication is also a good enough reason to try SMS marketing. You can easily get response from your customers and you can accordingly make modifications in your product.


**4.** **Instant intimation about the up and running offers**


Who doesn’t like getting informed about the latest offers, discounts and sales? Well, every customer does! Messaging is hence the better way to pool people to try something unique you have to offer, that too with an added discount, or something people might be interested in.

**5.** **Delivering information, but the S-S way – short and simple**


SMS marketing ensures that the information does not only reach the customer instantaneously, but it is also appeals them. Because today nobody likes explanatory information and long lectures highlighting what you have exactly got to offer. People prefer something short and crisp, which delivers the essence of the information to be conveyed. And what could be better than SMS?


**6.** **Targeting matters** 


We are saying this because today’s customers are intelligent enough to choose between products. They know the difference between what’s good for them and what’s not. Hence, giving respect to their needs and priorities, it becomes the duty of the marketer to focus ONLY on the target market and not flood everyone with unnecessary information about your product or offerings. With SMS marketing, only a set group of target customers can be reached at ease without bombarding the uninterested people with messages.

Try to consider the above basic ones first, and then discover what impact it makes on the sales of your product. After all, there is no harm in giving it a try – something that is good and worthy enough.

As mentioned in our previous blog- [User Initiated WhatsApp call](https://msg91.com/guide/whatsapp-voice-calling-for-businesses-everything-you-need-to-get-started), weâ€™re now live with WhatsApp outbound calling for businesses.

**Business-Initiated WhatsApp Voice Calls (Outbound Calls)**  

When your agent makes a voice call to a customer directly from WhatsApp, itâ€™s a business-initiated call. These calls are **chargeable**, and the pricing depends on two factors:

-   The duration of the call (Per minute charges)
-   The country code of the recipient's phone number

This opens up a new way for businesses to reach out instantly, especially for support, follow-ups, or lead conversions.

The most awaited time of the year has arrived. Enjoy, have fun, go crazy, and do all that you always longed to do but couldn’t do because of shortage of time. The best time of the year is here and you are all set to do all that you planned round the year.


And, don’t forget that tiny little SMSs are at your service to let you free yourself completely. Here is how they can assist you:  

 


1. **Movie Alerts**  

The three ‘I’s of a movie take you out of this world to a world which you can’t resist to enjoy but love. Just Imagine, Involve and Indulge yourself in the movie and then see the magic of silver screen. Nothing can be better than it. Chill out this summer with a good movie and popcorn at your hand. All the cinema houses take good care of you by sending in alerts regarding new releases, your booking status, any schedule changes or any offers and discounts. Hangout with your best pals and have a great family time watching movies!
2. **Library Updates**  

Books are the best refreshers. Curl yourself in couch with a nice book in hand, and a cup of coffee. Expand the wings of your imagination and move places at your comfort. Nothing can beat the experience of book reading and losing yourself in it. Enroll yourself in a good library nearby and enjoy the perks offered. The library people will update you about bestsellers of the week/month, new arrivals, reminders regarding issuing and returning date of the book and everything for which you needed to go to the library earlier. Just sit back and relax with your book!

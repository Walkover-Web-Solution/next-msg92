### **Here is the list of 10 must-have features for you!**

Instant messaging is oh so popular but did you know it is the plain old SMS that people prefer for their professional as well as personal lives. SMS is still the number one choice for business communication as it has a whopping 98% open rate and works on every single mobile phone.

### But how do you [get the best SMS experience](https://msg91.com/) on Android?

You’ll obviously need a great text messaging app, but there are add-ons that can bring functionality and features you always wished for. To enhance your texting experience we bring you a list of features:

* ******Identify Unknown Numbers******

Does your texting app identify unknown numbers? Relying on crowd intelligence to block spam, your android SMS app can identify unknown numbers and block messages coming from them.

* ******Identify Sender IDs******

A sender ID is the simplest way to let people receiving the SMS know who the SMS is from, but do you know what is simpler? Replacing the sender ID with the name of the brand makes it easier to search the SMS.

* ******Smart Reply Suggestion******

Anticipating a user's needs and catering to them is what makes an app successful. A smart reply feature suggests pre-generated replies and all a user would require to do is click the reply and it’ll be auto-inserted saving you the trouble of typing.

* ******Autoresponder/SMS Scheduler******

With an autoresponder, you can set profiles and compose replies that will get automatically sent when you activate a profile and for scheduling, you just need to select the date and time, write the message, and add contacts from your address book.

* ******Sync, Read and Send******

Syncing your texts across devices allows you to even send and receive SMS from your computer, tablet and other devices.

* ******Customization******

Everything from the background, notifications, contacts, emoji and bubbles can be completely customized. You can give individual conversations custom themes as well. Also, you can pick the notification icon colour and alert tone that plays when you get a new message.

* ******Switch Conversations******

Creating tabs for each of your conversations allows you to easily switch between them.

* ******Check The Delivery Status******

The ability to check the status of a text message to see if it was delivered to the recipient is a feature found on most mobile phones. On the Android OS though, you have to enable the feature that provides this information as it is usually disabled by default.

* ******MMS For Longer Messages******

A great power user feature is the ability to force the texts to go from SMS to MMS for longer messages. This avoids the garbled message groups that sometimes happen with long conversations.

* ******Enhanced Privacy******

A lot of people have taken a greater interest in privacy these days. Over-the-top end-to-end encrypted messaging offers that. The app can be your default android SMS app so it can receive both encrypted messages through the service and standard texts.

Life as a green bubble can be tough but putting in some extra efforts always works. [Peruse the Play Store to find the SMS app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.msg91.android&hl=en_IN) that will deliver the experience with features and functionality you’re after.

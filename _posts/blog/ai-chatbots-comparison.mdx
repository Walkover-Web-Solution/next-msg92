In an era dominated by automation and conversational intelligence, Agentic AI is redefining how businesses engage users.

Whether you're building chatbots for support, sales, or internal productivity, the right language model makes all the difference.

## **What Are AI Chatbots and Why They Matter**

AI chatbots are digital assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating human-like language. From streamlining support desks to assisting with content creation and real-time decision-making, AI chatbots help teams scale operations without compromising on experience.

Choosing the right chatbot engine determines how effective your bot is at tasks like code suggestions, customer engagement, or multilingual responses. MSG91’s Agentic AI lets you mix-and-match LLMs for use cases that best suit your business logic.

### **• ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

With a deep contextual memory and refined reasoning skills, ChatGPT is a top choice for content-heavy tasks, business communications, and customer support bots. It’s known for its balanced output and API stability.

### **• Gemini (Google)**

Gemini shines in integrating with Google services and surfacing real-time data. Its search-powered architecture makes it ideal for up-to-date content and research-heavy bots.

### **• LLaMA (Meta)**

LLaMA brings flexible deployment and high performance for edge devices or closed environments. It’s optimal for privacy-sensitive applications and developers who want more control over model tuning.

## **Pricing & Availability**

All three LLMs—ChatGPT, Gemini, and LLaMA—are included in MSG91’s Hello Plan under **Fair Use Policy**, so you can explore each without extra cost initially. If you exceed the fair usage or want to use your own advanced version, simply integrate the LLM of your choice by entering your API key.
<br/>
In that case, you will be billed directly by the respective LLM provider, and you can always check their official websites for up-to-date pricing details. Integration in MSG91 is seamless and takes just a few seconds.

## **Best Use Cases by Model**

These recommendations focus strictly on chatbot use:

* **ChatGPT**: Ideal for customer service bots that require long context handling and natural conversation flow.  
* **Gemini**: Great for bots that need up-to-date info, multilingual capabilities, or integration with Google services.  
* **LLaMA**: Perfect for privacy-sensitive bots or bots deployed in isolated/internal environments with self-hosting needs.

MSG91 lets you assign different models to specific bot flows—such as using Gemini for pre-sales queries and ChatGPT for onboarding assistance.

---

## **Verdict: Which One to Choose?**

If your primary focus is **bot building**, here’s how to decide:

* Use **ChatGPT** for dynamic, multi-turn conversations and empathetic responses.  
* Go with **Gemini** when you need bots to reference real-time data or offer localized language support.  
* Choose **LLaMA** when data privacy or on-premise control is your priority.

MSG91 makes it easy to switch between them even mid-development—so you can test and find the best match for your bot’s tone and workflow.

## **Final Thoughts**

MSG91 supports all major LLMs natively in Agentic AI. Our recommendation: **try all of them one-by-one in Draft mode**, evaluate how each handles your use case, and **go live only with the one that best suits your bot needs**.

## **FAQs**

**Q1: Can I use multiple LLMs in a single chatbot flow?** Yes\! Agentic AI allows node-based model switching. This means that within a single bot flow, you can assign different LLMs to different segments based on their strengths—like using Gemini for data-rich interactions and ChatGPT for empathetic onboarding.

**Q2: Do I need to manage API keys for each LLM?** No, MSG91 manages the API keys for built-in LLMs under the Hello plan with fair usage limits. If you want to use your own instance or a specific paid tier, simply paste your API key. MSG91 will handle the integration automatically.

**Q3: Is LLaMA suitable for commercial bot deployment?** Absolutely. LLaMA is best suited when data control, customization, or offline access is essential. You can deploy it in your environment and connect it with MSG91's platform easily. Our system supports self-hosted models too.

**Q4: How do I get started?** Sign up on [MSG91](https://msg91.com), and once you're in the MSG91 Dashboard, click on [Hello](https://msg91.com/hello). Under Hello, navigate to **All Bots**.

#### How well you communicate a message is as important as the message itself.


Countless efforts fail only because of poor communication, be it internal or external. An organization might have the best plans, best models, best business cases, the best employees and even the best customers, but if the communication is poor, all the efforts put would not yield the expected results.


Clear and meaningful conversation requires 4 components:


1. The Sender
2. The Receiver
3. The Content

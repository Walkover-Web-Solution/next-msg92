#### How well you communicate a message is as important as the message itself.


Countless efforts fail only because of poor communication, be it internal or external. An organization might have the best plans, best models, best business cases, the best employees and even the best customers, but if the communication is poor, all the efforts put would not yield the expected results.


Clear and meaningful conversation requires 4 components:


1. The Sender
2. The Receiver
3. The Content
4. The Channel


Itâ€™s important to focus on what you are communicating, but it is also important to focus on how youâ€™re communicating it.


Implementing communication tactics can improve your communication be it within your organization with your employees or outside with your customers. To connect, engage and motivate you need to follow these best 12 communication practices.


1. ####  **First Envision, Then Plan**


What do you want communication to do for your business? Where does it stand right now? How will you get there? Also, how soon you want to be there?


Before you begin, answer these types of questions to create a plan or a strategy. Simple or elaborate, general or specific, internal or external â€“ itsâ€™ up to you. A well-formulated mobile marketing strategy will give you an idea of where to begin, help you keep track and make you more efficient in reaching your end goal.

3. ####  **Include Metrics When Possible**


Anything that we measure and watch, improves. 


Metrics inform your people and your customers about your goals and the progress made towards it. It can be a motivator on different levels.


4. ####  **Feedback and Ideas**


The shortest word in the English language containing the letters a,b,c,d,e,f, feedback plays a major role in any companyâ€™s success. 


This includes feedback from employees, customers, partners and whoever is a part of the growth of your organization. Whether it is about the workspace, product, services or your company as a whole, a feedback channel can help you get some brilliant ideas and drop some not so brilliant ones.


5. ####  **Say No To Communication Overload**


Thereâ€™s loads of information to share and the ease of instant correspondence makes it all the more easier but, is it actually required?


As it with everything else, less is more, but with business communication, it is the relevant the better. Keep it simple, brief and at regular intervals.

6. ####  **Donâ€™t Just Notify â€“ Influence**


Itâ€™s important for you to inform but it is important for customers to act on the information. 


Call to action messages, motivational quotes, rewards and offers; go above and beyond.


7. ####  **Share Industry Trends**


Your team and your customers are not just a part of your company but also a part of the industry. 


Share industry insights, trends, news updates and encourage your team members to do so too.

Use internal communication to align your employees with your customers. 


Create personas of typical customers complete with demographics and metrics making customers vivid and tangible.

You do realize that not many of your customers might be experts in your fields, but you should be.


Respect your customerâ€™s time and use a more customized approach to communication. Quick and professional service is a great way to increase the possibility of a sale.


10. ####  **Leave Them Wanting More**


Communication with your customer should be informative, but not too long. 


If the quality mentioned is appealing to the client, they will want to come back sooner than you think.


11. ####  **Some Need More Communication Than Others**


Some customers generally need much more effort than others. 


The good news is, clients who spend more are the ones who require more work. So if you are [educating your clients](https://msg91.com/transactional-sms/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=int&utm_campaign=two) well on their services, this shouldnâ€™t be a big issue.


12. ####  **Communication Needs To Be Constant And Ongoing**

Share your stories, happiness and the benefits you bring to the community.

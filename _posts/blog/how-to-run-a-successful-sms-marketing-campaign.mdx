3. ####  **Know Thy Audience**

But don’t worry, you’ll start collecting user info the minute you start and the next time you’ll have real data to work with.


4. ####  **Know Thy Technology**

5. ####  **Know Thy Opt-Ins**


To run a successful SMS campaign, you need people to opt-in on your SMS list and for that, you need to give them options to opt-in through contact forms, pop-up boxes, welcome gates, social media platforms, ads and other possible options.


6. ####  **Know Thy Follow-ups**


Once you know your goals, SMS types, technology and audience that you’ve attracted through opt-ins, it’s time to plan your SMS marketing campaign. A good approach is to note:


* Type of SMS
* Content
* Call to action
* SMS frequency


7. ####  **Know Thy Copy**


It’s time to write your SMS copy.


For best results,


* Keep it to the point (as if you have an option, remember 160 characters only)
* Address users by their name (personalized SMS are more successful)
* Add contextual content (something that is of value to your audience)
* Add short URL (allowing users to open a web page/video/ poll directly)


Of course, you don’t have to add everything in one SMS. An ideal SMS will be short with a clear call to action and an expiry (if there is) creating a sense of urgency.


8. ####  **Know Thy Results**


Sending your SMS is just the first step in achieving success, nailing it requires good data for future campaigns. It means testing your SMS – sender ID, marketing copy, call to action, different audience, send time, open rates, click rates, opt-in, opt-out and wherever else it is possible to help you figure out what is working best for your SMS marketing.

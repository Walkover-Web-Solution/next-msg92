4. ####  **Know Thy Technology**

6. ####  **Know Thy Follow-ups**


Once you know your goals, SMS types, technology and audience that you’ve attracted through opt-ins, it’s time to plan your SMS marketing campaign. A good approach is to note:

* Call to action
* SMS frequency


7. ####  **Know Thy Copy**


It’s time to write your SMS copy.


For best results,


* Keep it to the point (as if you have an option, remember 160 characters only)

* Add contextual content (something that is of value to your audience)
* Add short URL (allowing users to open a web page/video/ poll directly)

It means testing your SMS – sender ID, marketing copy, call to action, different audience, send time, open rates, click rates, opt-in, opt-out and wherever else it is possible to help you figure out what is working best for your SMS marketing.

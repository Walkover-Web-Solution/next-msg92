WhatsApp Marketing has exploded in popularity, and for good reason. With a staggering 98% open rate, it blows traditional email and SMS campaigns out of the water. But with WhatsApp introducing new marketing message limits, businesses need to adapt their strategies. Don't worry, MSG91's CPaaS platform empowers you to craft effective WhatsApp marketing messages that comply with new guidelines and nurture stronger customer relationships.

****

Why WhatsApp Marketing?

****

- Unmatched Engagement: People check WhatsApp constantly, leading to superior open rates and click-through rates compared to other channels.

- Rich Media Capabilities: Go beyond text with images, videos, GIFs, and buttons to create engaging and interactive marketing campaigns.

- Personalized Communication: Segment your audience and send targeted messages that resonate with their interests and needs.

- Two-Way Communication: Unlike one-way broadcasts, WhatsApp fosters conversations, allowing you to build stronger customer relationships.

****

In a significant shift, WhatsApp implemented a new system in February 2024 that limits the number of marketing conversations a customer can receive from any business within a specific timeframe.  **This means any marketing messages sent beyond that limit will be blocked by WhatsApp.**  These limits were first implemented in India and will be rolled out globally by April 2024.

****

Attention! This change requires a strategic overhaul of your current WhatsApp marketing tactics.  The focus needs to shift from quantity to quality interactions. Importantly, the limit applies only to initiating new marketing conversations, not to ongoing engagements.

****

**Encountering delivery issues indicated by error codes 131026 (Cloud API) and 1026 (On-Premises API)** signifies you've reached the limit for initiating new conversations.  This doesn't mean you can't continue communication with existing contacts who have already interacted with your business.  In such cases, focus on providing exceptional customer service, responding to inquiries, and nurturing those valuable relationships.

****

Here's what you need to do:

****

- Focus on Quality, Not Quantity: Sending high-value, relevant content that addresses user needs is crucial.

- Prioritize Opt-in and User Consent: Building a permission-based marketing list is essential. Users must explicitly opt-in to receive your WhatsApp marketing messages.

- Respond, Don't Blast: Focus on responding to user inquiries and building conversations organically, rather than solely initiating contact.

- Nurture Existing Relationships: Provide exceptional customer service, answer questions, offer personalized recommendations, and build long-term loyalty with those who have already opted-in.

****

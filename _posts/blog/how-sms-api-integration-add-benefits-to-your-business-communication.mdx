Be it the money transaction, sending new offers or the delivery updates, SMS API is the most used and trusted system in the world, which allows your business to notify your customers about the recent update directly. [Transactional SMS](https://msg91.com/transactional-sms/) is an automated message system that companies use to support their customers throughout their business journey. You must be familiar with the kind of message notification which says ‘this is an automated message’. This is what transactional SMS looks like. With the everyday growing online market, customers depend on these SMS updates. The most commonly used transactional SMS are delivery updates, confirmation pings, and welcome messages which is basically an SMS solution for business. Don’t we all wait for the ‘salary credited’ SMS at the beginning of every month? Well, it is all because of the transactional SMS.

  


**Benefits of Transactional SMS**

Nowadays, we wait for the transactional SMS to land on our phones just to get assured if the money transaction is successful or not. This is the power of SMS API that it is the least thought about, and yet the most used system. Even big tech giants are using SMS API and the two-factor authentication and OTPs are the newest forms. It’s fascinating how the bank sends you an SMS update about it after emailing your credit card statement.  


SMS API offers the businesses to send and receive SMS but you do not have to go through with the manual SMS system for this. It costs way less than other forms of business communication as these are web SMS. So you do not need someone to type the whole text manually. This system is convenient as people read it fast, and it assists the customers to communicate with the brand in a hassle-free manner.

Transactional SMS is different from the promotional texts sent by the marketing companies to promote their brands. Rather than buzzing the customers' phones with unnecessary text, it provides the necessary information to them, which indirectly helps them to connect with the brand.

  
The online market relies entirely on transactional SMS as it is the oldest companion in the market and is here to stay for many more years to come.

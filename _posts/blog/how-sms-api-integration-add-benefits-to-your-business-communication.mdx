**Benefits of Transactional SMS**

Nowadays, we wait for the transactional SMS to land on our phones just to get assured if the money transaction is successful or not. This is the power of SMS API that it is the least thought about, and yet the most used system. Even big tech giants are using SMS API and the two-factor authentication and OTPs are the newest forms. It’s fascinating how the bank sends you an SMS update about it after emailing your credit card statement.  


SMS API offers the businesses to send and receive SMS but you do not have to go through with the manual SMS system for this. It costs way less than other forms of business communication as these are web SMS. So you do not need someone to type the whole text manually. This system is convenient as people read it fast, and it assists the customers to communicate with the brand in a hassle-free manner.

Transactional SMS is different from the promotional texts sent by the marketing companies to promote their brands. Rather than buzzing the customers' phones with unnecessary text, it provides the necessary information to them, which indirectly helps them to connect with the brand.

  
The online market relies entirely on transactional SMS as it is the oldest companion in the market and is here to stay for many more years to come.

  


**Impact of SMS API on Different Sectors**  


Transactional SMS can be used by banking and finance companies, retail stores, travel websites, transportation apps and others. Service providers and insurance companies also use SMS API to keep their customers updated. Various data show that consumers actually prefer to receive these transactional SMS rather than opting for any other means of business communication.

According to the Transactional Messaging Consumer Report, 67 per cent of the consumers preferred to receive transactional messages from banking and financial companies. These transactional messages consist of balance updates from banks, money credited or debited updates, bewaring customers regarding fraud and others. Similarly, transactional SMS regarding retail store offers, purchase confirmations, in-store product information, flight delays or hotel check-out reminders are preferred by 55 per cent of consumers.  


Service company transactional messages are liked by 44 per cent and texts like cab confirmation and rejection are liked by 39 per cent of the consumers.  


These data are based on a survey conducted by Vibes in partnership with Equation Research on 1001 people.

**The Wrong Software Choice is Very, Very Expensive: Why MSG91 Hello Is Your Smart Affordable Alternative**

Choosing the wrong customer support software is more than an inconvenience—it's a financial disaster. Most businesses overpay for bloated platforms with hidden implementation costs, per-agent licensing fees, and vendor lock-in tactics. 50% of enterprises waste as much as 10% of their annual operating budget on SaaS products they don't use.

MSG91 Hello shatters this model with transparent, affordable pricing and powerful features designed for real businesses.

<br /> 
**Why MSG91 Hello Is Affordable**

No hidden costs. No surprise fees. Here's the pricing that changes the game.


**Live Chat:** ₹0/month (free forever) with unlimited tickets and 1 inbox


**Free Plan:** ₹0/month with 2 inboxes/month, 50 tickets/month. 


**Basic Plan:** ₹1,500/month (Popular choice) with 2 inboxes/month, 1,000 tickets/month


**Premium Plan:** ₹3,000/month with 3 inboxes/month, 2,000 tickets/month

Compare this to traditional platforms charging ₹8,000-25,000 per agent monthly, ₹4,00,000+ implementation fees, and ₹1,50,000+ integration costs. A business paying ₹1,20,000/month for a traditional platform saves **₹14,40,000 annually** by switching to MSG91 Hello's affordable solution. This affordable alternative delivers enterprise power at a fraction of traditional pricing—₹14,40,000 in year one alone. Over three years, that's **₹43,20,000 in savings**.

All prices are exclusive of 18% GST, maintaining complete transparency with no hidden charges.

<br /> 
**Extra Usage Made Simple**

MSG91 Hello offers flexible pricing for additional needs.


**Extra Inboxes:** ₹500/inbox/month (available in Basic and Premium plans)


**Extra Tickets:**

* Basic Plan: ₹0.5/ticket

* Premium Plan: ₹0.75/ticket

This pay-as-you-grow model ensures you only pay for what you actually use, eliminating the waste inherent in traditional per-agent pricing models.

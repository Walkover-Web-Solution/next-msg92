The holiday season is just around the corner. And, while the world is busy making a list of gifts to buy for their friends and family, marketers like you and I all around the world are busy ensuring our holiday campaigns hit the bull’s eye. But for that to happen we need to prepare before launching our most awaited marketing campaign.


As the holiday season approaches, there’s a shift in the buying behaviour of shoppers and research says it is quite a bit different than the rest of the year.


#### **Holiday shoppers are**


* Typically not shopping for themselves
* Cost-conscious
* Fickle with low brand loyalty


Giving us ample of opportunity to remarket, holiday shoppers make their next purchase surprisingly early


* Second purchase within next 30 days – 38.7%
* Following offseason – 42.4%
* Following holiday season – 7.2%
* 365+ days – 11.7%


Although loyalty of holiday shoppers is low, these stats clearly show you can work your magic if you strategize well. And to help you with a [successful marketing campaign](https://msg91.com/sms) here’s what you need to know.

Opt-in service suggests that the customer has given his consent to receiving the message and you are not sending messages to him/her at random. Opt-out on the other hand refers to withdrawing from the SMS service you earlier gave your consent to.

Therefore, now get only niche audience that is actually interested in your product and services.

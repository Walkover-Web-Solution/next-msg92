An **AI chatbot** in banking is an intelligent assistant that combines machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and real-time data to answer queries, process transactions, and support users. Unlike rule-based bots (which follow scripts), AI chatbots adapt, learn from every interaction, and handle complex questions with ease.  
 Platforms like [MSG91 WhatsApp Chatbot](https://msg91.com/whatsapp) empower banks to deliver personalized conversations on the world’s most popular messaging app, meeting customers where they already are.

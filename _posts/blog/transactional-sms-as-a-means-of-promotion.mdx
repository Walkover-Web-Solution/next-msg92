The definition of SMS promotion has gone under a drastic transformation over time, and so has ways of using it, but the primary objective has always remained the same – creating awareness for different services and products, and sending important notifications and alerts.

Part of this transformation is the rise and importance of [transaction SMS](https://msg91.com/transactional-sms/). Transaction SMS is a type of SMS between businesses and their consumers. These messages contain information essential for the use of the business’ services or products. For instance, if you implement two-factor authentication in your system, then you must send an OTP (one-time-password) to your users.   
  
Not long ago, businesses and organizations only had promotional SMS to push to their customers; but with the rise of transactional SMS, businesses now have the opportunity to push SMS items such as confirmation and reminders alerts.

**Difference Between Transactional SMS vs Promotional SMS**

Transactional and Promotional SMS are sometimes used interchangeably, and one might wonder about their differences. The difference is that while Transactional SMS are triggered by events, and sent by automated systems – for example, an order placement triggers an order confirmation message, Promotional SMS are manually sent by campaign personnel at random times and for random reasons.

A transactional SMS might be something like: “Dear Jane Doe, your order was successfully placed.” While a Promotional message might be: “Dear John Doe, Great summer offers for all brands.”

As stated above, transactional and promotional SMS are sometimes used interchangeably, and rightfully so. A transactional SMS can be structured to convey a promotional message. Think of this hypothetical SMS: “Dear customer, your Netflix subscription was successful. Upgrade to premium to enjoy more content.”  The first part of the message is a transactional SMS - notifying the client of a successful subscription. While the second part carries a promotional message - creating awareness for the premium package.

**Benefits Of Using Transaction SMS**

Although there are numerous benefits of sending transactional SMS, a few major ones are listed below:

**1. Prompt delivery of information** - The biggest benefit of using transactional SMSs as a means of promotion is that quality information can be delivered promptly to the customers without any sort of delay.

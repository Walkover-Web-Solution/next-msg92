My task is calling people who daily sign up in **MSG91**. I understand their requirements, segregate them and accordingly send them more information over SMS and email.


 


*Cut-Copy-Paste in Sheet, Email, Phone and lots of clicks.*


 


For every lead, this usually takes my ***2-3 minutes*** apart from my on call time. 


 


I realized that ***I was actually spending hours on google sheet*** to manage this entire data. 


 


**My usual protocol** –


I had to manage a master sheet where I used to add entire information of a Client and then depending on the data I used to move them to various different sheets. After moving them to different sheets, I used to send emails and SMS to those Clients.


 


**Brilliant tools that saved my life** –


I installed [**Trigger & Send**](https://learn.viasocket.com/trigger-send-4caf8b2f80f1#.mtz4zx5na) add-on. With this add-on, whenever Google form data is submitted and its entry is made in my Google Sheet, an automatic trigger is sent.


 


***Trigger & Send –***



I then used [**Socket**](https://viasocket.com/) URL to send this data. 


 


This is how it works:


***Data Captured in Socket –***

In **[Socket](https://viasocket.com),** I collected the data and triggered [**Sheetsu**](https://sheetsu.com/) Delete API which deletes data from my google sheet. I further used **Sheetsu Add API** to add this deleted data into another sheet, according to the type of data.


 


This is how Sheetsu plug looks in Socket

A further Email is sent to the Client according to its new segment, using Sendgrid email and finally using **MSG91 API**, an SMS is sent to the Client.


 


**These tools greatly** **helped me in my work, improved my productivity & helped me to manage my time efficiently.**

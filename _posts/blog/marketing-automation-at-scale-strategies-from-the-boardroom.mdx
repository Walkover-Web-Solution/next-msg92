### **Q&A – Questions from the audience answered by Mr Periwal**


**Q.** Any recommended tools which you have been using and found effective?


**A.** It depends on what your target is, marketing or sales-specific. Also, depends on what scale you will be starting on.


 


**Q.** For retargeting, should we change the deals or make the campaign again?


**A.** Retargeting should be around the current offer you are running. When creating a drip campaign, set up 4 to 5 deals and start introducing them to users.


 


**Q.** What is a good ratio for customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost?


**A.** For B2C, in eCommerce segment, it is between 1 to 2


      For SaaS, it is from 2 to 3.


 


**Q.** What are the best channels for travel apps to engage with users?


**A.** Performance-centric – Facebook and Google for segment targeting, reach, creative options and cost-effective.


 


**Q.** What’s your philosophy for scaling up – do you aim for 3-4 ideas with hockey stick growth or multiple ideas or changes with small incremental growth?


**A.** Multiple consistent projects that deliver incremental growth, consistency being the key. If you are able to grow 1% every day, by the end of the year you’d have scaled 38X. Even if you grow small, but on a daily basis, you can do wonders.


 


**Q.** How successful was the user journey campaign? How did you accomplish that?


**A.** Very successful. Once the entire user journey was set up, we realized missing opportunities where we weren’t reaching out to certain users. We were able to double up our revenue from organic channels through marketing and retargeting activities. The impact is huge.


 


**Q.** Which attribution model do you follow at ixigo and what is the contribution of marketing to the overall revenue? And, if you could give us a sense of split between marketing attributed revenue and non-attributed revenue.


**A.** The model we follow is last-click attribution. Growing healthily, aren’t spending more than our revenue in terms of marketing. Majority of our revenue is from organic users. We love driving revenue and retention from our product efforts rather than spending huge money on it.


 


**Q.** Are these principles applicable across sectors?


**A.** From B2C companies to B2B, SaaS companies, everywhere you can use these features and strategies.


 


**Q.** How do you think the marketing automation will impact the B2B industry?


**A.** It’s actually impacting both sales and marketing.


* Products have taken away redundant and laborious work
* Giving more data points to understand better opportunities
* Spend more time strategizing rather than continuously following up


Marketing automation technique will help you plan better and let you use those lost opportunities in a better manner.


 


**Q.** Sending promotional SMS without consent is a breach of their privacy. How can we run a marketing campaign without violating new leads privacy?


**A.** Send an introduction SMS and ask them if they’d be interested in receiving SMS from you. This will ensure people don’t lose confidence in your brand.


 


**Q.** Are MSG91 and CleverTap are looking for collaborations?


**A.** Yes, we surely are looking into it.

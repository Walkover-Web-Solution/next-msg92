### **🛑 Why Many Businesses Are Moving Away from Bird**

From inconsistent support to API hiccups, several users have raised concerns about MessageBird (now Bird). Here are some honest, real-world challenges businesses have faced:

---

### **Real Feedback from Bird Users**

**“Support takes ages to respond. We waited over 24 hours just to resolve a simple query.”**  
 — User review on Capterra

**“Our account got disabled with no warning. We couldn’t access our funds and didn’t get a clear reason.”**  
 — Feedback via SaaS Adviser

**“The API sometimes gives weird cost values or fails mid-campaign. We’ve had to re-run batches more than once.”**  
 — Reported on Saasworthy & Reddit forums

---

### **🔍 The Common Pain Points**

-   **Limited Support Hours**: Only available Monday to Friday, 9 am–5 pm. Faster support? Pay extra — up to €4,250/month for premium assistance.

-   **Unstable API & Billing Bugs**: Unreliable cost calculations and unexpected message behavior.

-   **Weak Automation Options**: Campaign scheduling and automation capabilities lag behind modern standards.

-   **Random Account Blocks**: Several businesses reported account suspensions without warning — affecting operations and cash flow.

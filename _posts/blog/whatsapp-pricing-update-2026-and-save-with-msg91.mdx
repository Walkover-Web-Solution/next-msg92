## Why MSG91 Offers the Lowest WhatsApp Pricing in India

Pricing changes are part of life, but how your provider handles them defines the relationship. You want a partner who is transparent, not someone who uses a price change to hide extra markups.

In India, we hate paying extra for nothing. Imagine you go to buy a movie ticket. If the ticket costs ₹200, you expect to pay ₹200. You wouldn't want to pay an extra "service fee" just for the privilege of standing in line. Most WhatsApp providers do exactly that—they take Meta's price and add their own Markup.

### The MSG91 Promise: Meta Price is Your Price

-   No Markup Over Meta Rates: Many platforms (like WATI, AiSensy, Interakt, Infobip,) add a markup on every single message. MSG91 bills only what Meta charges. It's clean, simple, and honest.
-   Always Current: You don’t need to track rate cards manually. With MSG91, your billing adjusts automatically the second Meta updates its pricing.
-   Ideal for High-Volume Scaling: When you send messages at scale, even a tiny markup adds up to a massive difference. By removing this extra cost, MSG91 ensures your expenses stay controlled as your business grows.In the fast-paced world of Indian enterprise, keeping your communication costs lean is the difference between a high-growth year and a budget crisis. As marketing message rates in India shift to ₹0.8631 on January 1, 2026, the "middleman markup" charged by many providers becomes a massive burden.

### Real Scenarios: Comparison With the Competition

Business is like a game of cricket—every single run (or rupee) counts when you're chasing a big target. Why give away free runs to a middleman when you can keep them for yourself?

MSG91’s direct-to-Meta pricing means you don't pay for unnecessary extras—you get the official marketing message rate of ₹0.7846.

-   WATI: Running a campaign of 10,00,000 marketing messages with WATI will cost you ₹0.94 per message, totaling ₹9,40,000. With MSG91, you stay at the transparent official price point, saving a massive ₹1,55,400.
-   AiSensy: When you scale up to 10,00,000 marketing messages, AiSensy’s ₹0.88 rate makes your bill ₹8,80,000. Using MSG91’s official rate keeps your costs significantly lower, saving you nearly ₹95,400.

*Many marketers put a lot of effort into making their marketing emails perfect. But, they often neglect transactional emails. These kinds of emails are generally believed to be boring, however, failing to recognize their potential could mean missing out on a significant opportunity. The average open rate of transactional emails is over [80%](https://www.mailgun.com/blog/email/email-open-rates-decoded/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20most%20transactional%20emails,somewhere%20between%2020%2D25%25.) proving that the chances of your brand being visible to your customers is high. Once you have their attention, managing the rest becomes more feasible. In this blog, we will discuss various aspects of transactional email and you’ll know how transactional mail service in India can make a difference. So, let’s get started!*

**Understanding Transactional Email**
-------------------------------------

Transactional emails are delivered to users after they have finished an action on a website or application, like making a purchase or subscribing to a newsletter. These emails are crucial because they give clients crucial details about their transactions, like order confirmations and delivery information. Additionally, transactional emails can help companies build confidence and trust with their clients by delivering timely information that enhances the client experience. However, a [study](https://www.mailjet.com/blog/email-best-practices/transactional-research-report/) shows that 93% of people confront that they would never repeat a purchase from the brand if they have got a bad transnational email experience. This makes it important for businesses to choose **transactional mail service** very carefully as it can impact the bottom line of their business.

### Difference between Transactional & Marketing Email

Transactional emails are different from marketing emails in that they are triggered by a commercial transaction between the user and the business. These emails provide information that relates to the transaction and aim to keep customers informed. This can bring a positive change to the business by keeping the customers informed about the brand. Marketing emails, on the other hand, aim to promote products or services and entice customers to complete a transaction. While transactional emails are short-term and low-cost with high open rates, marketing emails try to engage customers or lead to generating more business for the company.

# WhatsApp Business Pricing Update – Effective July 1, 2025

Meta has introduced a significant change in how WhatsApp Business messaging is billed, starting **July 1, 2025**. If your business relies on WhatsApp to communicate with customers, this update directly impacts how you plan and send your messages. Here’s everything you need to know in simple terms.

<br />

## **Key Changes at a Glance**

- **Per-Template Message Pricing**  
  WhatsApp will now charge **per message template sent** (instead of charging by session or conversation). Templates are categorized into **Marketing**, **Utility**, and **Authentication**.

- **Utility Templates**  
  Free **only if sent within the 24-hour customer service window** (after a customer messages you). Sent after that? They are chargeable.

- **Marketing Templates**  
  Now **always charged**, whether you send them during an active conversation or outside of it.

- **Authentication Templates**  
  Still charged as before, typically used for sending OTPs or login verification codes.

- **Free-form (Non-template) Messages**  
  Still allowed and free, but **only within the 24-hour customer window**. If 24 hours have passed since the last user message, you must use a template to reach out.

<br />

## **Real-World Examples to Understand the Change**

### **Scenario 1: Customer Initiates Chat, Business Sends Marketing Message**

- **9:00 AM** – Customer says: "Hi, I have an issue with my order."
- **9:05 AM** – Business replies with a marketing template:  
  "Thanks for reaching out! By the way, we're offering 15% off on similar products."

**Before July 1:** Free (because reply was within the 24-hour window).  
**After July 1:** Charged (marketing templates are now always chargeable).

---

### **Scenario 2: Two Marketing Templates Within Same Session**

- **9:00 AM** – Customer asks: "Do you have any offers today?"
- **9:15 AM** – Business replies: "Get 10% off today on selected items."
- **4:00 PM** – Business sends: "Hurry! Offer ends at midnight."

**Before July 1:** Free (both messages fell under the same open session).  
**After July 1:** Both marketing templates are charged separately.

---

### **Scenario 3: Business Starts Conversation with Marketing**

- **10:00 AM** – Business sends: "Special offer – 20% off today only!"
- **10:05 AM** – Customer replies: "Is this valid on accessories?"
- **10:15 AM** – Business replies with another marketing template.

**Before July 1:** Only the first marketing template was charged.  
**After July 1:** Both templates are charged individually.

---

## **Utility Templates**

### **Scenario 4: Business Sends Utility Template Without Customer Message**

- **10:00 AM** – Business sends: "Your invoice for Order #3495 is ready."

**Before & After July 1:** Charged (because the user did not initiate the session).

---

### **Scenario 5: Customer Initiates, Business Sends Utility Reply**

- **9:00 AM** – Customer asks: "When will my order arrive?"
- **9:05 AM** – Business replies: "It will be delivered today by 6 PM."

**Before & After July 1:** Free (utility reply within the active customer window).

---

### **Scenario 6: Utility Message Sent After 24 Hours**

- **Day 1, 9:00 AM** – Last customer message.
- **Day 2, 11:00 AM** – Business sends: "Reminder: Your order will be delivered today."

**Before & After July 1:** Charged (outside the 24-hour session).

---

## **Mixed Use**

### **Scenario 7: Utility + Marketing in One Session**

- **9:00 AM** – Customer asks: "When is my delivery scheduled?"
- **9:05 AM** – Business sends: "Delivery is scheduled between 10 AM – 1 PM."
- **12:00 PM** – Business sends: "Add gift wrap for a limited-time offer."

**Before July 1:** Free (all messages within open session).  
**After July 1:** Utility message is free; marketing message is charged.

---

## **Authentication Templates**

### **Scenario 8: Sending an OTP**

- **9:00 AM** – Business sends: "Your OTP is 8943. It is valid for 10 minutes."

**Before & After July 1:** Charged (authentication messages are always billable).

---

## **Free-Form Message Examples (Non-Template)**

These are simple text replies (not pre-approved templates) and are only allowed within 24 hours of a user message:

### **Example A:**  
Customer: "Hi, I have a query."  
Business: "Sure, please share your query."  
→ This is a free-form reply sent within the session. It is free.

### **Example B:**  
Customer: "I need help with my order."  
Business (within 5 minutes): "Happy to help! Can you provide your order number?"  
→ Also a free-form message within the 24-hour window. Free.

If 24 hours had passed and the business tried to reply with the same message, it would not be allowed unless sent as a pre-approved template, which would then be charged.

## **What This Means for Your Business**

- **Plan proactively:** Review how often you send marketing templates. You’ll now be billed for each instance.
- **Reply promptly:** Send utility replies within the 24-hour window to avoid charges.
- **Avoid misuse:** Don’t sneak promotions into utility templates; Meta may reject or reclassify them.
- **Template approval:** Make sure your templates are categorized correctly to avoid delivery failures.

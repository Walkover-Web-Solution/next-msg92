Meta has introduced a significant change in how WhatsApp Business messaging is billed, starting July 1, 2025\. If your business relies on WhatsApp to communicate with customers, this update directly impacts how you plan and send your messages. Here’s everything you need to know in simple terms.

## **Key Changes at a Glance**

-   **Per-Template Message Pricing**  
    WhatsApp will now charge per message template sent (instead of charging by session or conversation). Templates are categorized into Marketing, Utility, and Authentication.
-   **Utility Templates**  
    Free only if sent within the 24-hour customer service window (after a customer messages you). Sent after that? They are chargeable.
-   **Marketing Templates**  
    Now always charged, whether you send them during an active conversation or outside of it.
-   **Authentication Templates**  
    Still charged as before, typically used for sending OTPs or login verification codes.
-   **Service Session (User-Initiated, Free-Form Messaging)**:  
    A 24-hour window starts when a user messages; businesses can reply with free-form messages without extra cost. After 24 hours, only paid template messages are allowed.

## **Real-World Examples to Understand the Change**

### Terminology:

**Customer Service Window**  
AKA : Active customer window, 24-hour window, open session:  
\-It’s a 24-hour period that starts when a customer messages you.

-   A customer messages your business July 10, 2025, at 07:00 PM IST to inquire about a product.
-   A 24-hour customer service window opens, allowing you to respond with free-form messages or templates (like utility messages) without extra charges until July 10, 2025, at 07:00 PM IST.
-   If the customer service window is not open (i.e., the user hasn’t messaged you in the last 24 hours), you can only send template messages, and each delivered template message will incur a charge under the new pricing model.

## **Marketing Templates**

### Scenario 1: Customer Initiates Chat, Business Sends Marketing Message

-   9:00 AM – Customer says: Hi, I have an issue with my order.
-   9:05 AM – Business replies with a marketing template:  
    Thanks for reaching out\! By the way, we're offering 15% off on similar products.

Before July 1: Free (because reply was within the 24-hour window).  
After July 1: Charged (marketing templates are now always chargeable).

---

### Scenario 2: Two Marketing Templates Within Same Session

-   9:00 AM – Customer asks: Do you have any offers today?
-   9:15 AM – Business replies: Get 10% off today on selected items.
-   4:00 PM – Business sends: Hurry\! Offer ends at midnight.

Before July 1: Free (both messages fell under the same open session).  
After July 1: Both marketing templates are charged separately.

---

### Scenario 3: Business Starts Conversation with Marketing

-   10:00 AM – Business sends: Special offer – 20% off today only\!
-   10:05 AM – Customer replies: Is this valid on accessories?
-   10:15 AM – Business replies with another marketing template.

Before July 1: Only the first marketing template was charged.  
After July 1: Both templates are charged individually.

---

## **Utility Templates**

### Scenario 4: Business Sends Utility Template Without Customer Message

-   10:00 AM – Business sends: Your invoice for Order \#3495 is ready.

Before & After July 1: Charged (because the user did not initiate the session).

### Scenario 5: Customer Initiates, Business Sends 1 Utility Template

-   9:00 AM – Customer asks: When will my order arrive?
-   9:05 AM – Business replies: It will be delivered today by 6 PM.

Before & After July 1: Free (utility reply within the active customer window).

### Scenario 6: Customer Initiates, Business Sends 2 Utility Templates

-   9:00 AM – Customer messages: Hi, can you confirm if my payment went through?

-   9:05 AM – Business replies with Utility Template 1: Yes, we’ve received your payment for Order \#9876. Processing now.

-   12:00 PM **–** Business sends Utility Template 2: Update: Your order has been shipped and is expected to arrive by 6 PM.

Before & After July 1: Free (utility reply within the active customer window).

---

### Scenario 7: Utility Message Sent After 24 Hours of Customer’s Reply.

-   9:15 AM – Business sends: Your Order \#1234 is out for delivery, you can track the order from the link.
-   4:00 PM – Business sends: Order Update- You will receive your order \#1234 by 8:00 pm today.

Before July 1: Free (within the same 24-hour session)

After July 1: Still free, since both are utility templates sent during the active 24‑hour session.

---

## **Mixed Use**

### Scenario 8: Utility \+ Marketing in One Session

-   9:00 AM – Customer asks: When is my delivery scheduled?
-   9:05 AM – Business sends: Delivery is scheduled between 10 AM – 1 PM.
-   12:00 PM – Business sends: Add gift wrap for a limited-time offer.

Before July 1: Free (all messages within 24-hour session).  
After July 1: Utility message is free; marketing message is charged.

---

## **Authentication Templates**

### Scenario 9: Sending an OTP

-   9:00 AM – Business sends: Your OTP is 8943\. It is valid for 10 minutes.

Before & After July 1: Charged (authentication messages are always billable).

## **Free-Form Message Examples (Non-Template)**

These are simple text replies (not pre-approved templates) and are only allowed within 24 hours of a user message:

### Example A:

Customer: Hi, I have a query.  
Business: Sure, please share your query.  
→ This is a free-form reply sent within the session. It is free.

### Example B:

Customer: I need help with my order.  
Business (within 5 minutes): Happy to help\! Can you provide your order number?  
→ Also a free-form message within the 24-hour window. Free.  
If 24 hours had passed and the business tried to reply with the same message, it would not be allowed unless sent as a pre-approved template, which would then be charged.

-   Plan proactively: Review how often you send marketing templates. You’ll now be billed for each instance.
-   Reply promptly: Send utility replies within the 24-hour window to avoid charges.

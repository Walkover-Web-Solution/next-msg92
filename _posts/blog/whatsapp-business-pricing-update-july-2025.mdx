Meta is introducing a new [**WhatsApp Business pricing**](https://msg91.com/pricing/whatsapp) model starting **July 1, 2025**. It’s important for all businesses using WhatsApp messaging to understand how these changes may affect their communication costs and strategy.

<br />

## **Key Pricing Changes (Meta Update)**

-   **Per-Template Message Pricing:**  
    WhatsApp now charges businesses **per message template** (marketing, utility, authentication), replacing the old conversation-based system.

-   **Utility Templates:**  
    Free **only** when sent **within** the 24-hour customer service window; charged if outside that window.

-   **Marketing Templates:**  
    Now **always charged per message**—inside or outside the customer session.

-   **Authentication Templates:**  
    Charged per message.

<br />

> **Important Notes:**  
> Non-template (free-form) messages are free but only allowed within 24 hours of a user's message. Outside that window, only chargeable templates can be sent.
<br/>

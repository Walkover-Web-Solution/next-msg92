### **PVA: Phone Verified Accounts SMS at Registration**


At times it becomes difficult to know your customer and PVA is for making those difficult times easy. When any user fills up a registration form and submits it, PVA generates a unique code that is sent to the user on their registered mobile phone via SMS. Once the user enters the right code in the phone number verification page they are successfully registered with your site.


What PVA helps you do is verify the customer and their registered details so you know the transactions being made on your site are genuine.

## **What Is WhatsApp Coexistence?**

WhatsApp Coexistence is a smart way to use one single number for both personal chats and automated WhatsApp messages.
<span/>
It lets you:

* Chat manually with customers on the WhatsApp Business App, like you always do.

* At the same time, use the MSG91 platform and WhatsApp Cloud API to run bulk WhatsApp messages, send WhatsApp templates, and even automate replies and campaigns.

No need to switch between platforms. No need to lose your existing contacts, WhatsApp Groups, or Status updates. It’s the perfect mix of WhatsApp automation and personal connection.

---

## **When to Use WhatsApp Coexistence**

### **Retail Shops (Clothing, Electronics, Grocery)**

You use WhatsApp to take orders or answer questions. But during sales or festivals, sending messages one by one becomes a hassle.
<span/>
Real Example:  
You run a boutique or grocery shop. During Diwali, instead of forwarding a discount message to 100 customers, you send one bulk message using MSG91—while continuing personal chats on the WhatsApp App.

---

### **Beauty Salons or Spas**

You take appointments on WhatsApp and often forget to remind
<span/>
Real Example:  
You run a salon. You book appointments through WhatsApp, but use MSG91 to send auto-reminders like “Your appointment is tomorrow at 5 PM” without doing it manually.

---

###  **Tuition or Coaching Centers**

You reply to student queries directly, but sending test or timing reminders every time gets repetitive.
<span/>
Real Example:  
You teach tuitions. Students message you on WhatsApp, but MSG91 sends automatic reminders about tests, fee due dates, or schedule changes—saving you time.

---

### **Restaurants & Cloud Kitchens**

You take orders on WhatsApp but don’t always follow up, After delivering, you forget to ask for feedback or send promo offers for next time.
<span/>
Real Example:  
You’re a home baker. You reply to customer orders from your phone. A day after delivery, MSG91 sends a friendly “Hope you loved the cake\! Here’s 10% off your next order.”

---

 

## **You use WhatsApp Groups or Status for your business**

You regularly post on Status or coordinate using WhatsApp Groups—and want to keep doing that.
<span/>
Real Example:  
You’re an event planner. You use groups to manage vendors and Status to show event previews. MSG91 handles reminders and updates without interrupting how you already use WhatsApp.

---

## **Why Small & Medium Businesses Love WhatsApp Coexistence**

* Keep your existing WhatsApp App and number.

*  Send bulk messages and promotions with ease.

* Use smart WhatsApp templates and automated flows for reminders, offers, or feedback.

* Continue with your manual chats and WhatsApp Status updates like before.

*  Save time and scale your outreach without hiring a big team.

**Why are Transactional SMSes Becoming Popular?**
-------------------------------------------------

![](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2021/05/Group-17309.png)It is no secret that transactional messages are increasingly becoming more popular among businesses across industries. But why is that so - Read on to know the reasons.

**Accessibility**: Consumers are open to reading mobile texts throughout the day, unlike emails. Checking emails is time-bound, while the same consumers are not time-sensitive while looking up mobile messages. Also, emails are opened 90 minutes after they are received, much longer than it takes to open phone texts. What’s more, the open rate for text messages is as high as 98%. No wonder, text messages are seen and, hence, score much higher than emails in terms of visibility and connecting with the consumers.

**Short and crisp**: Transactional messages are to the point. Being brief and restricted within a few characters, it holds the attention of its target customer base, communicating the message clearly in the shortest possible time.

**Real-time:** Transactional SMSes enable customers to keep a real-time check on their financial transactions, current payment status, etc. It is the most relevant for businesses in the commercial sector but is not restricted to it solely.

**5 Ways of Using Transactional SMS for Your Business**
-------------------------------------------------------

**1.****Identity Verification******  
Identity verification is necessary in the current times to verify the authenticity of the personal data furnished by individuals. It is also essential for protecting security for the registered customer base. 

This explains the growing focus on the two-factor verification procedure that is growing exponentially in popularity. During a payment process, customers have to insert an OTP (One-Time Password), messaged by the transactional SMS gateway, after mentioning the CVV of the Debit/Credit Card. 

This will not only secure your processes but also gain the trust of your customers which can be a highly scalable value in the long run.  


**2.****Order Confirmations******  
A transactional SMS received when an order has just been placed provides a sense of relief to the customer. It saves the customer from worrying endlessly over whether the order has been actually placed and will reach them as expected. 

It serves as a token of assurance that the order has been successfully placed and will reach them within the promised date or time. It acts as one of the primary steps towards building a foundation for a long business-consumer relationship, contributing to brand reliability and customer delight.   


**3.****Shipping and Delivery Notifications******   
Real-time notifications regarding the existing status of an order helps in developing trust and a connection with the customer through transparency in business processes. 

Therefore, businesses keep customers informed about the real-time status of shipping, any changes in shipping, pickup of order by the delivery agent, final delivery, and more. Your customers being extremely busy with their lives, if you can keep them updated about all transactions at the tip of their hands, you are bound to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.  


**4.****Real-time Reminders******  
What better way to notify customers of a real-time update than a transactional SMS? As the article mentions previously, emails will usually go unnoticed for a long time till they are opened. 

A change of delivery time by a grocery app, intimation about a flight change, or upcoming turn at the table at a restaurant can be informed with emailing or a phone call but might not always be as effective as transactional SMSes. 

Phone calls face the risk of not being picked up and are also comparatively more time-consuming than a transactional message that can be sent at the click of a button. Real-time notifications over SMSes can optimize the customer experience in a more robust way.  


**5.****Appointment notifications******  
A customer missing out on a mutually decided appointment due to forgetfulness is a sales opportunity lost. How can a transactional SMS bail out a business and the customer out of this situation? 

A reminder message regarding an appointment at the parlour or with the doctor will go a long way in helping customers remember the date and time, and plan their schedules accordingly.

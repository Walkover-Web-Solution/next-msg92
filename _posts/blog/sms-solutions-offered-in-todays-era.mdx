SMS still stands as one of the best options when it comes to promoting a product, intimating someone of something, fund raising, sending reminders, et al. With the evolution of concepts like bulk SMS, voice SMS and international SMS, mobile business has emerged as the finest ways to reach a bigger and better audience.


SMS or Short Messaging Service is an ideal way of communicating with your users without disturbing them. You can make them aware about anything in succinct language at their convenience. **Bulk SMS** is different from normal text SMS in the sense that bulk SMS lets you send same message to your target users in volume so as to remind them of something/promoting your product/intimating about anything else. Whether you are running a business, some promotional ad campaign, or a coaching class, you can use bulk SMS service in your favor by targeting your audience and sending them messages in bulk, thereby drawing them towards your service. As a business person, you can purchase SMS’s in bulk from a bulk SMS provider and then become a reseller of it by selling the SMS’s at higher rates.


**Voice SMS** is a feature that gives your message a voice. This rich feature is generally used as a reminder or announcement where the user receives voice reminders.


**SMS virtual number** is a long code service for a 10 digit virtual mobile number. The basic advantage of this service is that it is accessible globally and it comes as a tailor-made service for companies who do not want their users to pay premium SMS charges in case they send any queries. This service works best for a closed group, i.e. employees, retailers, wholesalers, and existing customers who can easily get hold of any information with long code. An example of SMS virtual number is mobile applications that provide you easy recharge options by sending them a message on the virtual number provided by them.


**SMS short code or short numbers** are short and special telephone numbers that can be used to send messages from fixed phones or service provider’s mobile phones. These numbers are special because they are not only easy to remember but they can be used for specific causes such as reality TV shows voting, donations purpose, casting votes for a certain cause, and much more. The only drawback of short numbers is that they are available only in India.

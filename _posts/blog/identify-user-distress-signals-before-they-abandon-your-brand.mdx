Although we are living in a time where information is abundant, we are also living in an era of skipping. With a limited attention span, one second less than the notoriously ill-focused goldfish that has an attention span of mere nine seconds; it is becoming more and more difficult to keep the visitor enticed enough to stay loyal towards a brand.

| **On an average, a visitor leaves your website in 10-20 seconds.** |


The question here is, if the visitor will not stick to your website for more than 20 seconds how will they understand what you have on offer for them? But even before this question arises, another question. Why would a visitor leave a website in 10-20 seconds?


*We have the answer for it right here.*


There are certain pain points or frustrations that viewers commonly feel while browsing a website and based on these points decide to leave a website, sometimes even before 10 seconds, scary eh!


**#1 Not Mobile-Friendly**


**#2 Bad Navigation**


**#3 Monotonous Content**


**#4 Poor Customer Service**


**#5 Not Staying Connected With Customers**


Now that you know major pain points and spend time and resources correcting the pain points, develop a strategic marketing campaign that drives qualified traffic to your brand’s website and is seeing a storm of visitors land on your site, but again, they leave after only brief visits. They’re not sticking around and they’re certainly not converting and contributing to the revenue. Now what?

| **On an average, 96% of people who visit a website will leave without becoming a lead or converting.** |


While some people might leave your website due to some pain points or maybe some of these people landed on your site to get some information and weren’t looking to convert at all. Whatever the reason be, there’s still an opportunity to nurture some of these people simply by identifying user distress signal before they actually abandon your brand for good. And believe us, it’s not difficult.


Tracking how users interact with your site, gaining user feedback, analyzing engagement campaigns, identifying seasonal trends…yes, it is quite possible to understand what’s going through your user’s mind and here’s how you can know it too.


1. ####  **Heatmaps And Feedback**


Measure your user’s engagement by knowing where they are clicking, scrolling or even moving their mouse on which of your pages. What it will give you is a visual understanding of how users are interacting with your pages, whether or not they are clicking at the right places, and if they are still dropping off, from where.


Use feedback for pages you getting high abandonment to know what your users are thinking.


2. ####  **Track For Effectiveness**


Assess the number of views and clicks on short URLs, pop-ups along with how many submissions they actually lead to. If you find it isn’t performing well, consider editing or removing the pop-up to create a better user experience for your visitors. You can also run A/B variation tests to test out various copy and offers.


3. ####  **Chat Window**


The ability to talk to users one-on-one allows you to monitor leads and also create opportunities by delivering support to clients, helping in retaining them.

| *Take an example of an online wedding planning website*
*Your website relies heavily on weddings and it is a complete family thing. You’d probably get lots of wonderful yet sometimes weird questions about ideas, venues, catering, photography etc.*
*Sounds familiar?*
*Now here’s something to ponder over –*
*Being able to answer questions through real-time chat adds a layer of reassurance for the guest.*
*This is how you develop trust and improve funnel conversion rate.* |


4. ####  **Keep Your Current User Base Engaged**


Not the one to interact with your customers on a personal basis, no problem. Implement some exit-intent strategy so there’s a message that triggers when users are mousing outside of the website.


And, with analysis of visitor behaviour, purchase history and traffic source implementing the exit-intent strategy will be a cakewalk.


5. ####  **Remarketing Campaigns**


Advertising platforms like Google, Facebook offer the ability to re-engage with users, using either cookie lists or email identification and in case of the third-party platform, re-targeting across various platforms including through emails, [SMS](https://msg91.com/), instant messaging and other mediums.


Remarketing can be used to re-engage especially with users who enter your goal funnel but abandon without completing the given goal.

| *Take an example of a hotel booking through an online booking process –*
*You go online to book a hotel, but for some reasons don’t complete the booking—maybe you wait to show your options to a friend or got distracted by a different site or simply decided to book until later.*
*Sounds familiar?*
*Now here’s something to ponder over –*
*As you browse the web, say over the next 7 days, you see an advert for the same hotel you were about to book in your Facebook newsfeed and even see the adverts across other platforms? You’d be more likely to book the hotel, wouldn’t you?*
*This is how re-marketing works by bringing people back into your booking funnel.* |


6. ####  **Make It Easy With API**


Rather than asking regular to verify themselves every time they visit your site, make it easy to authenticate users via 2FA. The lesser the time customers spend doing things they don’t want to, better are the chances for them to retain on your website.


Make it convenient to communicate to the users via API by syncing data across all communication channels by offering them [real-time updates with SMS](https://msg91.com/), push notifications, OTP. It has a mammoth impact on customer retention, making it one of the best channels to reach the audience based on customer behaviour.


7. ####  **Identify Seasonal Trends**


Consumers behaviour shifts throughout the year depending on timely events, and to remain competitive, marketing strategies and tactics need to shift, as well.

| *Take an example of the e-commerce niche*
*You need to come up with an idea of how you can relate your product or brand to a given holiday. Your pitch needs to be timely and relevant.*
*Now here’s something to ponder over-*
*You could use tools to predict which gadgets will be in high demand during a particular holiday. For example during Halloween, through analytics, it was seen that fake blood was more popular than witch hat.*
*That was just an example, but it shows how you can make your pitch relevant.* |


A customer’s journey is a puzzle that continues to challenge all and that too, on a daily basis. There are multiple factors that influence whether or not a customer will stick to a brand and they take place both online as well as off across multiple platforms and over an unpredictable period of time.


However, there are techniques and tools that need to be implemented to consistently help improve the flow of customers and also, to drive customers back if and when they abandon.


How do you identify user distress signal and what techniques you use to cope with abandonment? Also, what kind of results have you seen? We’ll be glad to get your insights into it.

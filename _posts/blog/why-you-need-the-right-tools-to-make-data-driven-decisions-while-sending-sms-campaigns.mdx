More than [730 million people](https://www.slicktext.com/blog/2018/11/44-mind-blowing-sms-marketing-and-texting-statistics/) in India sent SMS messages in 2018. Now more than ever, it’s crucial that you create an SMS strategy that’s capable of reaching that large audience.


What makes SMS different from other forms of communication is that text messaging is direct and to the point. You get very little space to catch a user’s attention but it’s immediate. 


It’s imperative to use the right tools to increase your customer engagement. With the right tools, you can better understand your target audience, what’s trending in your industry, and the type of content they want to engage with.


SMS Communication at a Glance
-----------------------------


We often receive text messages regarding sales on certain products or containing receipt from a recent transaction from the local grocery store. Large companies like these benefit from SMS communication since it allows them to reach a large volume of customers with minimal effort.


**Some uses for SMS communication include:**


* **Advertising new deals:** Is there a sale on home décor on Star Bazaar? Spread the word with SMS and get more customers aware of the discounts. A survey by Salesforce confirmed that [77% of customers](https://brandcdn.exacttarget.com/sites/exacttarget/files/deliverables/etmc-2014mobilebehaviorreport.pdf) subscribe to a company’s text messaging newsletter for coupons and discounts.
* **Providing shipping updates:** The modern consumer expects fast shipping and delivery, so give them peace of mind that their order is on its way by texting shipping and delivery updates over SMS.
* **Conducting surveys:** 31% of consumers [respond to SMS surveys](https://www.business.com/articles/6-reasons-brands-should-start-using-sms-marketing/). After communicating with a customer, you can ask them to rate their experience over text. Services like Reliance use this way to collect feedback from their customers.
* **Printing receipts:** Instead of fumbling with a long receipt from a week’s worth of groceries, stores can use text messaging to provide convenient digital copies.
* **Scheduling appointments:** Whether it’s an eye exam or a dentist appointment, many businesses benefit from quickly making plans with their customers over SMS.

SMS is not only a beginner’s tactic that only small businesses can take advantage of. Large companies are using SMS every day to boost their sales and customer engagement.

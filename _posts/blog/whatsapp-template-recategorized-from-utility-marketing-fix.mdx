## **MSG91 Does Not Support Marketing Content in Utility Templates**
At MSG91, we strictly do not promote or support the creation of marketing message templates under the Utility category on
WhatsApp.
<br/>
This goes against Meta’s official guidelines and can result in template rejection or recategorization to Marketing, which
impacts both delivery and pricing.
<br/>
👉 To avoid such issues, always follow Meta’s template rules: [ WhatsApp Template Guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/)
<br/>

If your **Utility template** was built per the rules but **still got recategorized as Marketing**, don’t worry — there’s
a way to get it reviewed and corrected.
## **✅ Steps to Review or Appeal a Recategorized Template:**

-   **Check Meta’s Updated Utility Template Guidelines:** [View Guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing/new-template-guidelines/)

No longer is the price or product a reason for customers to do business with you, today it’s all about customer experience.


The competition is not limited but has become more about delivering a great experience. But the important question is how?


Customer relationship management (CRM) system can help you improve the experience you provide to your customers and in this article, we’ll tell you all about it.


### **Customer Experience – A Top Priority**


Leaving behind criteria as product and price, in just 2 years’ time – in 2020 – customer experience will be the leading brand differentiator when it comes to buying decision and it’s not only us but [studies](https://www.walkerinfo.com/knowledge-center/webcasts/customers-2020) too state the same.


So what do you need to do differently to create an exceptional experience for your customer – be proactive.


And what does that mean? It’s simple – anticipating and catering to customers’ current and future needs.


A [study by inContact](http://www.incontact.com/call-center-industy-news/us-consumers-want-todays-companies-be-proactive-customer-service) revealed that 87% of adults want to be contacted proactively by an organization or company. Proactive service is about the ability to answer customer questions before they even ask them. And believe us when we say, it is going to be a big factor if organisations are serious about trying to meet customer expectations.


Fortunately, there are technologies available to help you proactively be in contact with your customers and one of the best options is the CRM software.


Enabling you to get a 360-degree view of your customer that can be used to create customized offers based on their demographics, interests, buying behaviour and more here’s how you can use CRM software to improvise your customer experience.


1. #### STAY CONNECTED

Use your CRM software as a customer loyalty enhancement tool to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty by keeping in touch with them at the crucial touch points. The CRM system can contain a wide range of information of each and every customer allowing you to segment and address the right audience at the right time with the right communication medium.

5. #### KEEPING UP WITH THE CUSTOMERS


Today’s customer demand attention and response on their terms, and not yours. This means that you will have to connect with your customers at a time, place and in the form that they choose.


Since they have access to many competing offers, you need to a medium with an enhanced speed at which you can present your own offers.

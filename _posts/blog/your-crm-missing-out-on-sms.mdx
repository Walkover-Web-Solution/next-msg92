No longer is the price or product a reason for customers to do business with you, today it’s all about customer experience.


The competition is not limited but has become more about delivering a great experience. But the important question is how?


Customer relationship management (CRM) system can help you improve the experience you provide to your customers and in this article, we’ll tell you all about it.


### **Customer Experience – A Top Priority**


Leaving behind criteria as product and price, in just 2 years’ time – in 2020 – customer experience will be the leading brand differentiator when it comes to buying decision and it’s not only us but [studies](https://www.walkerinfo.com/knowledge-center/webcasts/customers-2020) too state the same.


So what do you need to do differently to create an exceptional experience for your customer – be proactive.


And what does that mean? It’s simple – anticipating and catering to customers’ current and future needs.


A [study by inContact](http://www.incontact.com/call-center-industy-news/us-consumers-want-todays-companies-be-proactive-customer-service) revealed that 87% of adults want to be contacted proactively by an organization or company. Proactive service is about the ability to answer customer questions before they even ask them. And believe us when we say, it is going to be a big factor if organisations are serious about trying to meet customer expectations.


Fortunately, there are technologies available to help you proactively be in contact with your customers and one of the best options is the CRM software.

Once upon a time, becoming a national brand took lots of time and efforts. You’d launch someplace and then slowly build a local and then regional reputation, expand and then finally, with luck on your side, a great team and a lot of hard work, you’d enter the national market creating a name for yourself. 


But thanks to mobile you can reach the market anytime, even within hours of launching your brand.


It is the widest opportunity any business can think of, but it comes with a major challenge. 


### **In a country with hundreds of regional languages, how do you communicate effectively with the local customer base?**

### **Wouldn’t you love it if the brand you follow responds back to you in your regional language?**


[Customers prefer to do business in their own language from both](https://msg91.com/guide/send-sms-to-your-customers-in-their-local-language), a cultural and a linguistic point of view. Then what’s holding you back? You as a brand can communicate with your customers in their regional language increasing your chance of conversion. How, you ask?


#### **Language-Based SMS Or As We Call It UNICODE**


A land of many languages and dialects, Hindi is the official language in India and a sizeable population speaks Hindi while the rest are comfortable in their regional language. Though English is recognized as an official language, a majority of the Indian population still do not speak the language. Almost 60% of the urban population access content in regional language when compared to English.


And that is the reason that Facebook is available in several local languages and so is Wikipedia. Also, Quora too launched their Q&A platform in Hindi and plans to launch it in several regional languages. According to Google, local language consumption is four times that of the English language.


With a 98% open-rate, SMS is the most powerful brand communication medium and it gives an option to [communicate in not just 1 or 2, but 18 regional languages](https://msg91.com/regional-sms/) including Hindi.

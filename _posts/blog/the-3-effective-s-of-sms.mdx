In today’s era, when time is something that is scarcely available, communication becomes a matter of concern. It is also necessary that due to lack of time your personal relations do not suffer.


Short Messaging Service enables staying connected with your near ones, but at cost-effective and trouble-free options.


The three ‘S’ of SMS which make keeping-in-touch possible include:


1. **Short**  

Lengthy conversations are boring and time consuming as well. To avoid such length and save time, SMS proves to be the most effective way to deliver the message in the shortest way possible.
2. **Simple**  

Simplicity is the essence of a conversation. This is because simple conversations strike a chord with the people and prove to be effective when at the same time prolonged conversations lack substance.
3. **Sweet**  

Who likes lengthy conversations that do not only consume time, but do not add substance to the communication being carried out as well? Messages serve as the best option to communicate at such juncture since they are concise in nature and do not divert from the main topic.

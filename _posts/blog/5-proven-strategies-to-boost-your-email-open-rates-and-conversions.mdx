## **5 Proven Strategies to Boost Your Email Open Rates & Conversions**

Even with a strong [email marketing strategy](https://msg91.com/in/email), optimizing open rates and conversions requires constant testing and refinement. Here are five proven strategies to help your emails stand out and drive higher engagement:

### **1\. Optimize Your Subject Lines for Maximum Impact**

Your subject line is the first impression—make it count.

Keep it **short & compelling** (ideal length: **6-10** words).  
Use **urgency** or **curiosity** (e.g., “Limited-time offer—Only 3 hours left\!”).  
**Personalize** it (e.g., “John, an exclusive deal just for you\!”).  
**Avoid spam** triggers like "free," "guarantee," or too many exclamation marks.

MSG91's [A/B testing feature](https://msg91.com/in/campaign) helps you to test subject lines to see what works best for your audience.

### **2\. Perfect Your Email Timing & Frequency**

When you send your emails matters just as much as the content.

**Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday** & **Thursday** tend to have the highest open rates.  
**Best time:** Early morning **(9-11 AM)** or late afternoon **(5-6 PM).**  
Avoid overloading users with daily emails \- stick to a consistent **schedule**.

[MSG91's Frequency feature](https://msg91.com/help/campaign/How-to-Create-a-Campaign-Flow) helps you to test different send times to identify your audience’s peak engagement hours.

### **3\. Focus on Mobile Optimization**

With **50%**\+ of emails opened on mobile, a responsive design is essential.

Use single-column **layouts** for easy readability.  
Keep **CTAs** bold and tappable.  
Reduce **image size** for faster loading.

[MSG91's Mobile Optimized](https://msg91.com/in/email) Template feature lets you preview and test emails across devices before hitting ‘send’\! 

**4\. Add Personalized & Dynamic Content**

Use **first names** in subject lines and email copy.  
Add **product recommendations** based on user history.  
**Customize offers** based on past interactions (e.g., “We noticed you love sneakers \- **here’s 10% off your next pair**\!”).

**Personalized emails** drive **26%** higher open rates.

### **5\. Clean Your Email List for Better Deliverability**

A **bad email list** \= low engagement \+ high spam complaints.

Remove **inactive subscribers** regularly.  
**Validate emails** before sending to avoid bounce rates.  
Use double **opt-in** to ensure genuine subscribers.

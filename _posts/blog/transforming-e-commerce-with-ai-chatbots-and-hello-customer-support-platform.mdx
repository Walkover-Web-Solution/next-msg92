The e-commerce landscape is evolving rapidly, and businesses must adopt intelligent solutions to enhance customer experience, drive sales, and streamline operations. **AI chatbots** and the **Hello Customer Support Platform** are revolutionizing commerce by managing the entire customer journey—from the first ad click to final payment, all within WhatsApp.

## **How Smart Chatbots Are Revolutionizing E-Commerce and Customer Support**

With the convenience of cash-on-delivery, seamless return policies, and an extensive range of products, consumers increasingly prefer shopping online. However, while brands invest heavily in marketing—leveraging trending audio reels, WhatsApp campaigns, and influencer collaborations—a major challenge remains: cart abandonment.

Retargeting these potential buyers can be difficult, especially when brands are already overwhelmed with customer inquiries.

**What is a marketing communication strategy and how to do it right?**


Simply put, a marketing communication strategy either used by an individual or an organization is a strategy used to convey the communication effectively. It includes a message (what you want to convey), a medium (the channel you use) and the target (to whom you want to convey).


P.S. – It can include press coverage, guest post, backlinks…


Let’s get started with your strategy!


The Why, What, How & Where & Of An Integrated Marketing Communication Strategy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


An insider tip – this is why, [why works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPYeCltXpxw).


**WHY** a killer marketing message is crucial to your integrated marketing communication strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Your message should be defined by 2 things – 


1. What you want to say
2. How you say it


Let’s take an example, if you sell LEDs, you can promote them in 3 different ways


“LEDs are the unsung heroes in the electronic world. It lasts 2-4 times more than your average CFL saving you on the maintenance and replacement cost.”


“LEDs are the unsung heroes in the electronic world. They operate well in both cold and hot temperatures.”


“LEDs are the unsung heroes in the electronic world. They are environmentally safe, unlike other traditional lightings.”


The core content of the message is the same, “LEDs are the unsung heroes in the electronic world.”, however the spin on the different target audience.


 


The first message would attract an audience who are looking to cut costs on the maintenance and energy bills. The second would attract an audience who live in extreme or fluctuating temperatures and the third one would hit a mark with people who live the eco-friendly life.


Creating a compelling message requires a deep understanding of 


* Your product
* Brand values
* Target audience


#### Now that you understand the importance of the content you share, let’s focus on creating a successful strategy.


**WHAT** basic principles are an integrated marketing communication strategy guided by –
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. ### **Brand Alignment**


The marketing channel you use should have the same brand perception as yours. 


2. ###  **Customer Alignment**


Be where your customer is – pick channels where they are active.


3. ###  **Budget Alignment**


Choose a channel that fits your budget.


**HOW** to create an integrated marketing communication strategy?
-----------------------------------------------------------------


### **I. Identify Your Target Audience**


Before you even begin to create a strategy, you need to understand your audience. Any plan you formulate has to be for a certain audience and to find your target group. 


To create highly targeted marketing message you need customer insights and the easiest way to do this is study your existing customers.


* What needs do most of your customers are looking to fulfil?
* Why are they buying your products or services?


Invest time to stay in touch with shifting customer needs as a marketing communication mix based on insufficient research is bound to be flawed.


### **II.  Define Your USP**


The foundation of your marketing strategy is your unique selling point and it should reflect in all the messages you send out; PR, content, sales.


To help you frame your USP analyze your company from the viewpoint of your target audience.


* Why will a consumer choose you over others?
* Where do you fall short of your competition?


A clear USP will ensure the message you send out is clear and consistent.


### **III. Marketing Communication Mix**


The combination of channels you use to reach out to your TG, your marketing communication mix could include


* Online advertising
* Offline advertising
* Content marketing
* Direct marketing
* Events, sponsorships, promotions…


If you are a larger organization, chances are your marketing plan will have campaigns across multiple channels to reach a wider audience. For a smaller organization, sticking to limited marketing channels makes sense otherwise you’d risk diluting both, your budget and your focus.


### **IV. Branding Identity**


A vital part of your integrated marketing, branding can be done on two levels.


Basic branding – it is about having a consistent look and feel across all your marketing platform.


* Website
* Apps
* Social platforms
* Sales collateral
* Direct marketing campaigns
* Advertising campaigns
* Business cards


Deeper branding – It is more about the core identity of your company and it should be a part of each and every communication.


### **V. Define Your Success**


Your integrated communication marketing strategy is only complete when you know what results you are expecting from it. For that, you need to define success metrics for all your communication channels and they will define how well your strategy is working.


After creating a hands-on strategy and a hitting message, let’s see **WHERE** you can find your target audience.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ### **Segmenting your prospect**

* High-priority
* Mid-priority

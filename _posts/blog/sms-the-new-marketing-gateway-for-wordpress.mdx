As a business owner, your ultimate goal is to provide your customers with convenient and accessible channels through which they can engage with you, and undoubtedly, SMS ticks all the checkboxes. And, if you run your business website on WordPress, then let us tell you why adding SMS functionality makes sense and how you can equip your site with this functionality.


According to a [report](https://apparelmag.com/deloitte-93-percent-consumers-use-their-phone-while-shopping), 64% of consumers who have the option to text a business would prefer to do that instead of call. Still wondering why you should integrate SMS on your WordPress website, here’s why


* SMS has a 98% open rate
* 90% of messages received are read within 3 minutes


SMS is a viable marketing channel as it offers


* Speed
* Timely delivery
* Higher open-rates
* Tracking
* Analysis
* And most importantly, it’s on mobile – where the world is.


Business communications via SMS, as it is, gets more views and, if your call to action is appealing enough, brings more engagement.


 


**What can you do with SMS on your WordPress site?**
----------------------------------------------------


You must’ve integrated marketing channels such as social, video, email to your site, but have you integrated SMS? Are you even aware of the full range of the capabilities SMS has to offer?


Let me tell you here itself, if you are thinking that SMS is only for super-sized e-commerce sites, you are mistaken. 


 


WordPress SMS Integration is beneficial for:


* Instant verification
* Confirmation of a signup
* 2-factor authentication
* E-commerce notifications for purchase confirmed, order processed, package shipped, etc.
* Customer feedback surveys
* Event announcements or reminders
* A heads-up about special, insider deals
* Sending discount codes and coupons
* Notification about new blog posts, video content, etc.
* Alerts related to exceeding account limits, password verifications, recent transactions…
* Confirmation for upcoming appointments
* Reminders that products need to be refilled or reordered
* Follow-ups after sending out important information
* SMS-only contests


 


A simple text message sent directly from your site not only allows you to remind or alert or inform your customers but also complements your other marketing efforts eventually driving them back to your site.


But before sending out texts to your visitors keep in mind these points:


* Send text messages only to visitors who have expressly given you permission to opt them in
* Include a STOP or OPT OUT option in the message
* Keep your messages under 160 characters
* Include a clear call-to-action.
* When including a link, optimize the landing page for mobile and remove any extra steps
* Don’t forget to schedule them for an optimal time and date

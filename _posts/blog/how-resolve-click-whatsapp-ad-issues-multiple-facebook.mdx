Running Meta ads for conversions or lead generation through Click-to-WhatsApp ads is an effective way to engage customers. However, users with multiple Facebook Business Manager accounts across different countries often encounter a frustrating issue they face errors when trying to add a WhatsApp number from a different account, resulting in the status remaining "Pending" indefinitely.

If you’re managing multiple business accounts (for example, **MSG91 Global** and **MSG91 India**) and want to run Click-to-WhatsApp ads that land users on a WhatsApp number associated with MSG91 Global, you’ll need to follow specific steps to avoid errors and ensure a successful setup.

### **Understanding the Problem**

Imagine you have the following setup:

* **MSG91 Global** has a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) and specific WhatsApp numbers.  
* **MSG91 India** also has a WABA with its own set of numbers.  
* The Facebook page you’re using is connected only to MSG91 India.

If you try to create a Click-to-WhatsApp ad using a number from MSG91 Global, the system will throw an error or keep the status in "Pending." This happens because the number and the Facebook page are not owned by the same business account, leading to a mismatch in ownership validation.

### **Solution: Steps to Successfully Run Click-to-WhatsApp Ads**

To resolve this issue and run ads without errors, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Create a Facebook Page Owned by MSG91 Global**

The first step is to ensure that the Facebook page you use for the ad is owned by the same business account as the WhatsApp number.

* Go to MSG91 Global and create a new Facebook page.  
* Ensure that this page is clearly linked to MSG91 Global.

  #### **Step 2: Ensure the WhatsApp Number is Owned by MSG91 Global**

If the number you want to use is not already under MSG91 Global’s WABA, you need to either add or migrate the number.

* **To Add a Number:**

  * Go to the WhatsApp Business Account section in MSG91 Global.  
  * Follow the steps to add the desired WhatsApp number.  
* **To Migrate a Number:**

  * If the number is currently owned by MSG91 India, initiate a migration process to transfer it to MSG91 Global.  
  * Ensure that the migration is completed successfully and verified.

  #### **Step 3: Verify Ownership Consistency**

Once the number and the Facebook page are both under MSG91 Global, verify the ownership:

* Go to the WABA settings under MSG91 Global.

* Check the ownership details. It should clearly state something like:

   **Example:**

  * WABA Name: MSG91 Testing  
  * ID: 143993792141439  
  * **Owned By: MSG91 Global**

Ensure that the "Owned By" field matches the company that owns the official Facebook page.

#### **Step 4: Connect the Facebook Page to the Correct WABA**

* Link the Facebook page to the WABA under MSG91 Global.  
* Ensure the number you want users to land on is correctly associated with this WABA.

  #### **Step 5: Create the Click-to-WhatsApp Ad**

* Go to your Ads Manager in MSG91 Global.  
* Create a new campaign and select the objective as "Lead Generation" or "Conversions."  
* Select the Facebook page and WhatsApp number that are now correctly linked under MSG91 Global.  
* Complete the ad setup and launch the campaign.

  ### **Why This Solution Works**

The key to resolving this issue is ensuring that both the Facebook page and the WhatsApp number are owned by the same business account. This ownership consistency allows Meta to validate the setup and eliminate the "Pending" error.

By following these steps, you can successfully run Click-to-WhatsApp ads without encountering errors, ensuring that your users land on the correct WhatsApp number.

### **Additional Best Practices for Optimizing Click-to-WhatsApp Ads**

#### **1\. Maintain Clear Documentation**

Ensure that you keep records of your WABA accounts, associated WhatsApp numbers, and Facebook pages. This documentation will help you quickly identify and resolve any inconsistencies.

#### **2\. Regularly Audit Ownership Details**

Periodically review the ownership details for your Facebook pages and WhatsApp numbers to ensure they are correctly aligned. This proactive approach can prevent future errors.

#### **3\. Leverage Audience Targeting**

Optimize your Click-to-WhatsApp ads by using detailed audience targeting based on location, demographics, and user behavior.

#### **4\. Monitor Ad Performance**

Continuously track the performance of your Click-to-WhatsApp ads. Analyze metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement levels to refine your strategies.

#### **5\. Seek Meta Support When Necessary**

If you encounter persistent issues, don’t hesitate to reach out to Meta support for assistance. They can provide guidance on complex account configurations and troubleshooting.

### **Final Tips for a Seamless Ad Experience**

* **Consistency is Key:** Ensure that both the Facebook page and WhatsApp number belong to the same business account.  
* **Migration Planning:** If a number needs to be migrated, plan the process carefully to minimize downtime.  
* **Testing:** Before launching large campaigns, test your Click-to-WhatsApp ads to ensure they function correctly.

By aligning your Facebook page and WhatsApp number under the same business account, you can overcome this common hurdle and optimize your Click-to-WhatsApp ad campaigns for better results.

### **Conclusion**

Managing multiple Facebook Business Manager accounts can be challenging, but with the right approach, you can successfully run Click-to-WhatsApp ads without errors. By following the steps outlined in this guide and maintaining consistent ownership between your Facebook pages and WhatsApp numbers, you’ll be well-positioned to achieve your advertising goals.

From January 1, 2026, Meta is updating WhatsApp message rates across several markets.

<span className='br_1' />
These are official WhatsApp Business Platform pricing changes and apply to every business — whether you are sending OTPs,
marketing campaigns, order updates, reminders, or customer notifications.
<span className='br_1' />
Some countries will see message prices increase. Some will see a drop. Some message categories will become cheaper; others
will become slightly costlier.
<span className='br_1' />
This impacts any business sending WhatsApp messages.
<span className='br_1' />
And that is why understanding the new pricing — with real, practical examples — becomes important before planning your communication
strategy.

The next-gen text messaging protocol, RCS, is set to offer a real change in the messaging experiences for consumers. having a significant impact on texting, image and GIF sharing. With an open, consistent and globally interoperable messaging service, many carriers are planning an upgrade to RCS from SMS.

**What is Rich Communication Service**?

Rich Communication Services, also known as RCS, is the next generation in [messaging technology](https://msg91.com/in/). RCS will include prominent features like high-resolution image and video sharing, payments, file sharing, location sharing (in real-time), video calls, and so on. All these features will be delivered through your device’s default messaging application without the need for any external messaging app like WhatsApp.  
  
**How does RCS work?**

Now that you know what a rich communication chat service is, it’s time to understand how it works. RCS is part of the protocol that is termed by carriers, as an Advanced Messaging standard. It is a significant improvement over the humble text messaging functionality that is available, by default, in most smartphones.

If you want to know what a rich communication service message is and how it is implemented, then think of various apps you have come across in the past that have read receipts, typing indicators, and advanced methods of sharing media on a large scale.

RCS functions within the native messaging app on your phone, you don’t have to download a third-party application, there is no need to set up user accounts, invite friends, or sign in to get started. But, if you want to send/receive RCS messages, then everyone will have to be on the same messaging application and a network that supports RCS enabled phones, i.e., Android to Android for example.

If you don’t use a device that is RCS enabled, then your messages will fall back and default to regular SMS or MMS formats.

**SMS:** Short Message Service is a texting technology that allows you to send messages over a cellular network. You don’t need mobile data or Wi-Fi to send or receive messages. This is a convenient option when you have limited or no internet connection.

**MMS:** MMS utilizes the cellular network to send and receive messages, just like SMS. However, what sets MMS apart is that it can transmit multimedia content. When using MMS, you can send images, audio files, contact cards, and so on, along with your text messages. You can make use of the phone's default messaging application to send and receive MMS texts.

**RCS:** RCS converts the native texting app into a live chat platform similar to how iMessage works between two iPhones. RCS is being heavily pushed by Google to enhance its built-in messaging application on Android phones. However, RCS messaging will require an active internet connection to transmit messages. RCS will be beneficial for businesses, especially if they want to send tickets, product delivery alerts, boarding passes, and payment links.

  
**Here are the key differences that set RCS apart from SMS:**  
Around in some form or other since 2007 when it was first proposed, RCS is the iteration of text messaging technology. The original standards over text messaging offer a number of enhancements including

* 8,000 character/message
* Supports read receipts and displays when the other person is typing
* Web-based chat and cross-platform message syncing
* Uses WiFi and mobile data to send messages
* Group chat
* Video and content sharing
* Social presence information
* Native audio messaging
* IP voice and video call
* End-to-end message encryption
* SMS fallback

These features might look like nothing new as they are common to many popular messaging apps, but they’re a massive upgrade over SMS.  
  
The adoption of the services wasn’t really taking off by phone manufacturers, mobile carriers and developers due to the required update implementation of network and software. But things are changing for RCS since Google announced the launch of a mobile industry initiative to accelerate the availability of rich communication services.  
  
A service provider, phone manufacturer and the arbiter of the Android OS, Google is pushing every carrier to upgrade to rich communication services. But its version of rich messaging service differs from the original RCS.

It marks an important step forward in bringing a better messaging experience for Android users everywhere.

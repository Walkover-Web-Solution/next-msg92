**Features of SMS API**
-----------------------

SMS API allows the sending and receiving of short text messages without using the Internet. Companies should choose a good SMS API to enhance productivity by conducting good customer engagement. Some features of a good SMS API are -

* **Scalability -** SMS API advances businesses to expand their customer reach by allowing them to send transactional messages in bulk. It, therefore, integrates API directly to the gateway, ensuring that SMS is sent to recipients worldwide. There is no need to worry about infrastructure or capacity constraints while sending multiple messages.
* **Greater Flexibility -** SMS APIs provide essential features like support for any character set in which you can send messages in any language, such as Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, etc., as it is Unicode oriented. Long message concatenation is also provided, and messages are not split across global networks. SMI API also offers delivery report notifications that track messages' delivery and at what time and date. It keeps all the records of the messages sent to customers or leads. Message queuing is also offered here, in which multiple messages can be sent in a single API request.
* **Automation -** SMS API provides automatic transactional messages to be sent to customers and leads in bulk. There is no need to manage customer engagement manually, and the SMS API keeps the communication running to manage transactions and other operations. The API workflows help to automate the process of sending automated messages on time to manage business operations.
* **Best Compliance -** SMI APIs are developed and maintained by highly knowledgeable tech specialists, so companies need not worry about API integration or anything because the API is implemented to meet the latest industrial and government standards. Now, the company can handle its marketing campaigns and customer engagement. SMS API provides message body purging, meaning the message body's content is not provided in the record details, and debug logs are cleared every 30 days. SMS API offers sensitive data protection, smart rate limiting, and automatic opt-out handling.
* **Dynamic Reporting & Tracking -** Message tagging is also offered as it informs which outbound message corresponds to which specific reply. It also tells the date and time of the message log records. Every transactional message is tracked to ensure it is delivered on time and to the right person.

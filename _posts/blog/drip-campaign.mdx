Ever been ghosted by a lead after sending that one email? Happens. And let’s be honest—blasting the same message to every user is like proposing marriage on a first date. Awkward. Ineffective.

<span />
That’s where drip campaigns walk in. Smart, charming, and perfectly timed. A drip campaign is a sequence of automated marketing
messages—mostly via email, but also through WhatsApp, SMS, RCS, and even voice—that are sent based on user behavior and preferences.
<span />
Think of it as your digital marketing twin—nurturing leads, nudging buyers, and gently whispering, “Hey, remember us?”
<span />
In this blog, we’ll unpack what drip campaigns really are, how to set them up across channels, and how MSG91 makes it effortless
and flexible.

## **What is a Drip Campaign?**

A drip campaign is a series of pre-written marketing messages—typically emails, but also WhatsApp, SMS, RCS, or voice—that get sent to users automatically based on their behavior, preferences, or timing.

<span />
Instead of one big campaign blast, drip campaigns deliver the right message to the right person at the right time. You set
the logic, and the system works in the background.
<span />
They’re:

-   **Automated** – You set it once, and it runs like clockwork.
-   **Triggered** – Based on specific actions like signup, cart abandon, or inactivity.
-   **Sequenced** – Builds engagement step by step over days or weeks.

Unlike traditional campaigns, drip campaigns feel more like a conversation than a shout.

## **Common Types of Drip Campaigns**

Let’s look at some high-impact use cases:

-   **Welcome Series**: Start the relationship right with a warm hello and onboarding tips.
-   **Lead Nurturing**: Share helpful content and nudge prospects along the decision journey.
-   **Cart Abandonment**: Reignite interest using emails or WhatsApp nudges.
-   **Re-engagement**: Bring back silent users with personalized touchpoints.

MSG91 makes it powerful by letting you combine Email, WhatsApp, RCS, SMS, and even voice calls into one unified campaign. That means your marketing message gets delivered—no matter how users prefer to receive it.

## **How to Set Up a Drip Campaign in 5 Steps**

### **1\. Define Your Goal**

Is it signups, purchases, webinar attendance, or feedback? Choose the action that matters most.

### **2\. Segment Your Audience**

Different people, different flows. Segment by geography, behavior, language, or time zone. MSG91 even lets you customize delivery by country’s local time or preferred language.

### **3\. Write Your Messages**

Short, smart, and personal. Personalize every touchpoint—whether it’s an email, SMS, or voice message.

### **4\. Set Triggers and Timings**

Trigger flows based on opens, clicks, inactivity, form fills, or even JS events. Schedule delays, test variants (A/B), and create conditional logic to optimize impact.

### **5\. Launch and Monitor**

Go live and track every detail—opens, replies, conversions. Use Slack or 500+ integrations to sync alerts and actions mid-campaign.

Bonus: You don’t need to change your email setup. MSG91 works seamlessly with Gmail, Outlook, and custom SMTP.

## **Best Practices for Drip Campaign Success**

-   **Keep Messages Relevant**: Speak to the user’s moment.
-   **Use Multichannel Smartly**: Mix email with SMS, WhatsApp or RCS based on user habits.
-   **Perfect the Timing**: Spread messages out logically.
-   **Always Add a CTA**: Tell users exactly what to do.
-   **Test and Optimize**: Refine subject lines, content, and delivery windows.
-   **Mobile Friendly**: Ensure everything works perfectly on phones.

## **Mistakes to Avoid**

-   **Overwhelming Users**: Don’t flood them across all channels.
-   **Ignoring Behavior**: A cart abandoner needs a different flow than a first-timer.
-   **Outdated Content**: Keep messages fresh.
-   **No Metrics Review**: If you're not improving, you’re guessing.

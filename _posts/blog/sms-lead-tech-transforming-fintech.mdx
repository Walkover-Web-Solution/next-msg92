A crowded and rapidly evolving sector, targeting the most relevant customers in the FinTech industry needs deep-level understanding and expertise.


The Financial Service Industry scene in India is red hot with many FinTech startups setting up, also the shift towards a cashless economy and changing user behaviour has a lot to do with it. Although the needed thrust is there, FinTech startups are still finding it hard to reach out to leads, converting them is even tougher.


The biggest challenge faced by the FinTech industry today is harnessing the lead.


#### **Market – Generate Lead – Convert Lead – Customer – Serve & Engage – Long-Term Customer**


The process remains the same, but it is easier said than done!


FinTech companies come from diverse areas, from small-time lending to wealth management, from consumer lending to asset management, from trading to payments and so many more areas.


Every company has their own set of marketing and outreach campaign and they aren’t necessarily based on customer segmentation via geographic, linguistic, or behaviour patterns. Besides each company has its own customer acquisition cost and not many have the tools and system to measure and manage the campaigns.


#### **Integrated marketing solution is the need of the industry and so is adapting to the ever-evolving market!**


Cold marketing is a thing of the past. Without a specific audience in mind, you are just firing without any aim. Quantifiable leads come from consumers who are already searching for a service. Addressing consumers with solutions, who don’t necessarily know what exactly they are looking for, can lead to a higher conversion rate.


#### **Know your customer and understand what mediums your customers prefer!**


Are they attracted by implicit marketing where you offer them tailor-made services?


For example, a visitor on your website wants to download a whitepaper and enters their phone number. Since the prospect has shared their phone number it implies they might be interested in your product or services. You can then send them personalized texts asking about their choices and then offering them customized services.


Or is it explicit marketing tactics that attract your prospects where you offer them free consultations when they sign up with your services?

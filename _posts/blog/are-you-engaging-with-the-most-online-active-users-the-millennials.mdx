**Customer Engagement With The Most Active Online Users- Millennials**  


Putting up a lot of pressure on marketers to do in-depth research are the technology consumers, the millennials who are termed as the quick learners, the first digital nerds of the 20th century, born between 1981 and 1996, this unique breed observing the economy through their digital lenses.   


Certainly tech-savvy online consumers, millennials keep an eagle eye on most of the purchases online. And this made us ponder, how important it is to reach such customers, and always keep them in a loop.

------------------------------------------------

The world has become a smaller place to live in, everything is connective and collective at the same time. The buyers and the sellers meet on an e-platform to shop and add their needs into an online cart.  


Most active online users show some surprising shopping skills on the internet, they navigate the whole internet space to look for that one product, check ratings and reviews or feedback of the resellers before making the purchase.

**What seeks attention is “customer behaviour”**

These masters of social media-  millennial customers are exceptionally loyal customers, they are more concerned with brand loyalty and highly demand the customer-centric shopping experience.    


Quite a few millennial resonate this sentiment, “*What engages me the most is not only product and services, but most importantly how I am being treated*”.  


When consumers are treated well, they tend to show their consumer loyalty and hence always stick to the brand.  


This online millennial generation is hard and fast, they easily adapt and are quite decisive. Certainly, the middle-aged (23-38yrs) people of the family are becoming the decision-makers and they are quite pro-active when it comes to choosing the best for them and their families.

1. 68% of all Millennials demand an integrated, seamless experiencewhile shopping. That means being able to [**cloud communicate**](http://www.msg91.com) with the vendors effortlessly from customer service to product shipping to exchange/return once at all.
2. In this AI and chatbot world, customers want their brands to assist them actively, send them updates, information, or [**emails**](https://msg91.com/transactional-email/). They love the brands or opt for the ones who are highly influential and make them stand out from the crowd.
3. Use of New Media can be highly effective while creating a positive buzz for the brand, also consistent cross-channel communication and offering personalized interaction is another key.

**The traditional generation is still young, emerging millennials are breaking the stereotypes.**

The traditional era has passed but the purchasing power is still there. The millennial generation is the trendsetter and is a true player in influencing the old generation.  


### A bridge between analog and digital era- Millennials

Generation X (roughly from the early 1960s to late 1970s) has to do what their kids demand and they tend to fulfill it. Millennials have reversed the process, they are bringing Gen X into the new age category.

So, Marketers if you are neglecting the old traditional generation, you are in for a big loss.

After all, *olds don't look that old- they are retro!*  


![](https://images-msg91.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2020/10/tenor.gif)Generation X follows the millennials to fulfil their needs. **Gen Xers are asking a lot more questions:**  

* How do fee structures work?
* What am I paying for?
* Can I do this myself?
* What will be the ultimate benefit?

In addition, millennials direct their parents and help them become self-dependent:

* How to use self-banking platforms,
* How to do research, compare products and services, and even
* When and where to invest.

This shows that Millennials not only transform their shopping behavior but those of their parents. In order to take over this emerging consumer market, the new industry marketers need not leave the old generation behind, instead, take them along.  


To close this emerging consumer generation gap, retail leaders need to take action now to provide a [**seamless end-to-end experience**](https://msg91.com/) to Millennials' demand.

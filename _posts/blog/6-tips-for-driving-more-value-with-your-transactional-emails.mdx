-----------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Keep it informative**

What does your recipient want from these emails? Information regarding the action they have taken on your site or app. You can use these emails to promote, but the sole aim of these emails is to convey the information your customers are looking for.  


**2. Sound like a human & not automated**

The email was created to communicate with one another. If you want your subscribers to engage with your emails, you need to get that robotic tone out.  


**3. Design for mobile screens**

Agreed transactions still happen more often on desktops, but emails are often read on mobiles. Finger-friendly navigation will make your emails interactive for viewers using different screens.  


**4. Match your brand’s look & feel**

Transactional emails are a part of your communication strategy so make sure every transactional email you send reflects your brand identity. Branding your emails will not only make your business recognizable but also help your business stand out in your recipients’ inboxes.   


**5. Suggest the action customer needs to take**

No matter how good your transactional emails are if you don’t include a clear call to action you want your recipient to take, they won’t take any action. Make sure you include a clear CTA in your email.   


**6. Personalise the experience**

Your customers receive transactional emails, frequently, from other businesses too. The only way to differentiate your mailers is to personalize them. Also, personalizing your email copy can result in better click rates.

With a fresh new intention to restrict sending of promotional messages by unregistered telemarketers, the telecom operators have oh-so-substantially increased the prices of Bulk messages.


The new prices would come into effect from 7th November 2012, 12 AM, and would be applicable to the existing as well as prospective users of our services. No such hike in Bulk SMS prices was expected beforehand and the team at MSG 91 has no control over the altered prices and needs to comply with the newly introduced rule by the respective telecom operators.


After a lot of debate about what the change should constitute, the SMS cap for normal mobile SMS has been set to 100 SMSs per day, after which 0.50 paisa per SMS would be charged by the telecom operators for sending SMS.


MSG 91 carries no intention to restrict the quality of services being given to its clients and it assures to continue offering eminent SMS solutions at cost-effective options. All the other terms and conditions, except the pricing, remains the same.


The exact nature of the altered prices can be confirmed by visiting: **\<https://msg91.com>**


We appreciate the persistent support of the clients of MSG 91 and wish for your continued support.

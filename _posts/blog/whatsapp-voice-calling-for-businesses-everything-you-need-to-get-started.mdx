## **How It Works: 4 Simple Rules You Should Know**

### **1\. First, Set Up [WhatsApp on MSG91](https://msg91.com/whatsapp)**

To use WhatsApp Voice, your WhatsApp number must be integrated and live on the MSG91’s WhatsApp panel.  Once your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) is connected, voice and messaging features work in one place — through the Hello panel.

### **2\. Your WhatsApp Number tier limit must be 1000+ Messages/Day**

Only Meta Approved WhatsApp Business Number that have the tier limit of 1,000 or more messages per day can enable voice calls.  
 This makes sure the feature is available only to businesses with regular customer interactions — not one-off or low-usage accounts.

### **3\. Customer Must Message First to your business.**

Customers will only see the call button after they send you a message on your Business WhatsApp Number.  
This protects the experience from unwanted calls and ensures conversations happen when they’re actually needed.

### **4\. Inbound Calls Only (For Now)**

You can’t initiate voice calls to your customers on WhatsApp — they can only call you.  
 This keeps the interaction in the customer’s control and ensures your team only answers when it’s relevant and requested.

The Outbound Calls will be available soon. *Stay tuned with MSG91.*

## **Why and When to Use WhatsApp Voice**

Not everything can (or should) be handled over text. Some issues are urgent, some are too detailed to type, and some just need a human voice. That’s where WhatsApp Voice comes in — quick, clear, and right inside the same chat.
<span/>
**Here’s when it works best:**

* **Businesses with high chat volumes** – Speed up resolution and reduce the load with real conversations.

* **Industries where timing is everything** – Travel, e-commerce, healthcare, logistics — where waiting is not an option.

* **Customer-first brands** – Voice calls only activate after the customer messages you, keeping it consent-based and relevant.

* **MSG91 Hello users** – Already using the Hello panel? Voice fits right in. One place for chat, voice, logs — no extra tools needed.

**Real moments that make voice better:**

*\~I ordered Medium, but got Large — and the seal was broken.*  
 One quick call → issue understood → replacement processed.
<span/>
*\~My booking shows 5 PM, but I chose 6\. Can I shift it to Friday?*  
 A 30-second call → corrected and re-confirmed.
<span/>
*\~Do I need to fast for tomorrow’s test? And what’s the location again?*  
 A fast voice reply → no confusion, no missed appointment.
<span/>
If you’re solving real customer problems every day, WhatsApp Voice gives you the clarity and speed your team (and your customers) will love.

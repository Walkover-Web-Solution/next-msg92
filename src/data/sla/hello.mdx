   **Target Resolution:** Within 24 hours

* ### **P3 – Medium Impact**

## **5\. Scheduled Maintenance**

To ensure optimal performance, security, and feature upgrades of the Hello platform, MSG91 occasionally conducts scheduled maintenance. These activities may require temporary downtime or limited access to certain features.

* **Advance Notification:**  
  All scheduled maintenance windows will be communicated to customers **at least 24 hours in advance** through any of these official channels including **Email**, **WhatsApp**, and **SMS**, to help you plan accordingly.

* **Maintenance Timing:**  
   We aim to schedule such activities during **non-peak hours** to minimize impact on your operations. However, the timing may vary depending on the nature of the updates or infrastructure enhancements.

* **No Impact on SLA Uptime Calculation:**  
   Any downtime occurring due to **pre-notified scheduled maintenance** will **not** be counted against the monthly uptime calculation outlined in this SLA.

* **Customer Awareness:**  
   It is the customer's responsibility to stay informed through the communication channels provided, and plan usage accordingly during maintenance periods.

This proactive approach allows us to maintain service quality while keeping you informed every step of the way.

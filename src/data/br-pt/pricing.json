If you send more than 100,000 emails in a month, you will be charged an additional 0.02/- per email. Additionally, if you perform more than 100 email validations, you will be charged 0.25/- per validation. This amount will be deducted from your MSG91 wallet. The Extra section in every email plans displays this information."

                        "answer": "You, as the user, can set the monthly spending limit, while the postpaid billing limit can only be set by the MSG91. If you have exhausted the emails and validations allotted according to your subscribed plan and wish to send more emails or validate additional email IDs, MSG91 will deduct the excess usage amount from your wallet when you reach 90% of your postpaid billing limit. After this deduction, your postpaid billing limit will reset to the default. If your consumption continues and reaches 90% of your postpaid billing limit again, another deduction will occur from your wallet. In this situation, the total maximum deduction aligns with the monthly spending limit you've set."

                                To send RCS messages using an API, you can use MSG91's services. With MSG91, businesses
                                can integrate RCS messaging directly into their applications to reach customers more
                                interactively. Alternatively, to send RCS messages on mobile, you can use an RCS-enabled
                                app like Google Messages. Both the sender and recipient need to have RCS activated
                                through their carrier or app settings for messages to be delivered with RCS features.

                <span className="c-fs-4">
                A cookie is a piece of data contained in a small file stored in the web browser. It contains a string of letters and numbers called as identifiers that are sent by a web server to a web browser. Each time the browser requests a page from the server, the identifier is sent back to the server.
                    <div className="my-3"></div>
                    Cookies allow MSG91 to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on our publicly accessible website (www.msg91.com) and identify users returning to the website. This helps make users navigating and interacting with our website and account portal more easy and efficient.

                    By themselves, cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies you, the visitor, but the personal information that you share, like signing into the account, may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

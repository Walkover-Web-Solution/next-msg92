                    What personal information do we collect from the people who visit our blog, website, or app?
                </strong>
                <p>
                    We collect various types of information from or through the Service. The legal bases for MSG91’s
                    processing of Personal Data are primarily that the processing is necessary for providing the Service
                    in accordance with our Terms of Service, and that the processing is carried out in MSG91’s
                    legitimate interests, which are further explained in the section "How do we use your information?"
                    of this Policy. We may also process data upon your consent, asking for it as appropriate.
                </p>

                <p>User-Provided Information</p>
                <p>
                    When you use the Service, as a User or as a Visitor, you may provide, and we may collect Personal
                    Data. Examples of Personal Data include name, email address, mobile phone number, and credit card or
                    other billing information. Personal Data also includes other information, such as geographic area or
                    preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific
                    individual. You may provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Service. For example, when
                    you register for an Account, use the Service, post Client Data, interact with other users of the
                    Service through communication or messaging capabilities, or send us customer-service-related
                    requests.
                </p>

                <p>Information Collected by Clients</p>
                <p>
                    A Client or User may store or upload Client Data into the Service. MSG91 has no direct relationship
                    with the individuals whose Personal Data it hosts as part of Client Data. Each Client is responsible
                    for providing notice to its customers and third parties concerning the purpose for which Client
                    collects their Personal Data and how this Personal Data is processed through the Service as part of
                    Client Data.
                </p>

                <p>Automatically Collected Information</p>
                <p>
                    When a User or Visitor uses the Service, we may automatically record certain information from the
                    User’s or Visitor’s device by using various types of technology, including cookies, "pixels," or
                    “web beacons." This automatically collected information may include an IP address or other device
                    address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites visited just before or just
                    after using the Service, the pages or other content the User or Visitor views or interacts with on
                    the Service, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or use of the Service. We may also use
                    these technologies to collect information regarding a Visitor's or User's interaction with email
                    messages, such as whether the Visitor or User opens, clicks on, or forwards a message. This
                    information is gathered from all Users and Visitors.

                <p>Analytics</p>
                <p>
                    We use Google Analytics to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on the Public Area of the Site
                    and create user navigation reports for our Site administrators. Google operates independently from
                    us and has its own privacy policy, which we strongly suggest you review. Google may use the
                    information collected through Google Analytics to evaluate Users' and Visitors’ activity on our
                    Site. For more information, see Google Analytics Privacy and Data Sharing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We take measures to protect the technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. The
                    data collected will only be used on a need-to-know basis to resolve technical issues, administer the
                    Site, and identify visitor preferences, but in this case, the data will be in a non-identifiable
                    form. We do not use any of this information to identify Visitors or Users.
                </p>

                <strong>To whom do we disclose information?</strong>
                <p>
                    Except as described in this Policy, we will not intentionally disclose the Personal Data or Client
                    Data that we collect or store on the Service to third parties without the consent of the applicable
                    Visitor, User, or Client. We may disclose information to third parties if you consent to us doing
                    so, as well as in the following circumstances:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unrestricted Information: Any information that you voluntarily choose to include in a Public Area of

                    have access to, or process Personal Data or Client Data as part of providing those services for us.
                    We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary
                    for them to perform their functions, and our contracts with them require them to maintain the
                    confidentiality of such information.

                    The Service is hosted in the United States or Germany. Regardless of the database being hosted

                    may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States
                    for storage and processing by our service providers listed in our Terms of Service. We will adhere
                    to GDPR requirements to ensure adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from
                    Europe to the US. Additionally, we may transfer your data to the US, the EEA, or other countries or

                <strong>Data Controller and Data Processor</strong>
                <p>
                    MSG91 does not own, control, or directly oversee the utilization of any of the Client Data stored or
                    processed by a Client or User through the Service. Only the Client or Users have the authority to
                    access, retrieve, and govern the use of such Client Data. MSG91 has limited awareness of the
                    specific Client Data being stored or made accessible by a Client or User through the Service. MSG91
                    does not directly access this Client Data except when authorized by the Client or when necessary to
                    provide Services to the Client and its Users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As MSG91 neither collects nor determines the usage of any Personal Data within the Client Data, and
                    because it doesn't establish the purposes, methods of collection, or the uses of this Personal Data,
                    MSG91 is not operating as a data controller under the European Union's General Data Protection
                    Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, "GDPR"). Thus, it does not carry the associated
                    responsibilities stipulated by the GDPR. MSG91 should be regarded solely as a data processor on
                    behalf of its Clients and Users concerning any Client Data containing Personal Data that falls under
                    the GDPR's requirements. Except as outlined in this Privacy Policy, MSG91 does not independently
                    facilitate the transfer or provision of Client Data containing Personal Data to third parties. This
                    is only done through third-party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of MSG91 while
                    delivering Services to Clients. Such actions are executed or authorized solely by the respective
                    Client or User.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Client or the User, as per the Regulation, serves as the data controller for any Client Data
                    containing Personal Data. This means that such a party governs the method by which Personal Data is
                    collected and utilized, as well as determining the purposes and means of processing such Personal
                    Data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MSG91 is not accountable for the content of the Personal Data within the Client Data or other
                    information stored on its servers (or subcontractors' servers) based on the Client's or User's
                    discretion. MSG91 is also not responsible for how the Client or User manages, discloses,
                    distributes, or otherwise processes such information.
                </p>

                <strong>Data Retention</strong>
                <p>
                    We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User’s account is active
                    or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we
                    have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as
                    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as
                    follows:

                <ol>
                    <li>the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 6 months of the date of closure.</li>

                    <li>
                        information on legal transactions between Client and MSG91 is retained for a period of 5 years.

                    We do not share any information that could readily identify you, such as your email address, with

                    these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Apart from what is discussed in this

                        For example, a website may offer local weather reports or traffic updates by storing your
                        current region in a cookie. These cookies can also remember alterations you've made to text
                        size, fonts, and other aspects of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to
                        provide services you've requested, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The
                        information collected by these cookies may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing

                        that are more relevant to your interests. They are also used to limit the frequency of
                        advertisement displays and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Typically, these
                        cookies are placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. They remember
                        that you've visited a website, and this information is shared with other organizations, such as

                <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
                <p>
                    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
                    INDIA, and the concepts they encompass have played a significant role in shaping data protection
                    laws worldwide. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how to implement them is
                    crucial for compliance with the various privacy laws that safeguard personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To align with the Fair Information Practices, we will take the following responsive actions in the
                    event of a data breach: We will notify you via email or through an in-site notification within 7
                    business days. We also commit to the Individual Redress Principle, which grants individuals the
                    right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to comply
                    with the law. This principle not only ensures that individuals have enforceable rights against data
                    users but also provides them with recourse to pursue legal action through courts or government
                    agencies to investigate and prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
                </p>

                    changes to this Privacy Policy that generally won't have a significant impact on how we use your
                    personal information, and such changes won't require an email notification.
